# Sit Happens — Pro CRM

## Original Problem Statement
Build a full-stack dog daycare/boarding CRM ("Sit Happens") starting from an HTML prototype. Replace localStorage with a real backend.

## User Choices
- **Scope:** Booking workflow + training logs + vaccine alerts + photo uploads (options b+c)
- **Auth:** Simple JWT email/password (admin + client roles)
- **Design:** Keep current dark theme exactly (slate base, shGreen #8cc63f, shBlue #00a9e0, shOrange #f26522)
- **Photos:** Yes — stored as base64 in MongoDB

## Architecture
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Motor (async MongoDB), bcrypt password hashing, PyJWT Bearer tokens (7-day expiry)
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Tailwind + FullCalendar (npm), axios with localStorage JWT
- **DB:** MongoDB `sit_happens_db` — collections: `users`, `clients`, `dogs`, `bookings`

## User Personas
1. **Admin** — Manages clients, dogs, bookings, schedules. Seeded from env (`admin@sithappens.com / admin123`).
2. **Client** — Books daycare/boarding via portal, sees dogs, manages own bookings. Account created by admin.

## Core Requirements
- Role-based auth (admin vs client)
- Client/Dog CRUD with owner relationships
- Vaccine tracking with expiry alerts (rabies required for booking)
- Booking workflow: client requests → admin approves → credits deducted (1 per day)
- Daycare capacity check (default 30/day)
- Training logs per dog (admin only)
- FullCalendar visualization of bookings
- Dashboard with daycare occupancy, boarding count, health flags, total dogs

## Implemented (2026-01)
- ✅ JWT auth with bcrypt + admin seeding (idempotent)
- ✅ Client CRUD + portal account creation
- ✅ Dog CRUD with photo (base64), vaccines, training logs
- ✅ Booking endpoints (create/approve/reject/cancel) with full validation
- ✅ Availability endpoint (capacity + vaccine check)
- ✅ Dashboard stats endpoint
- ✅ Calendar events endpoint (FullCalendar JSON)
- ✅ Portal `/api/portal/me` (client info + credits)
- ✅ Login screen + admin shell (Dashboard, Schedule, Bookings, Clients, Dogs)
- ✅ Client Portal with booking flow + credit display
- ✅ 100% backend tests passing (20/20), frontend smoke tested

## Sprint 2 — Brand Kit + Day-of Toolkit (2026-01)
- ✅ Husky logo branding on login, admin sidebar, and client portal
- ✅ Tagline "Dog Training • Daycare • Boarding" + new browser title + favicon
- ✅ **Vaccine Alerts Banner** on dashboard (expired/missing/expiring rabies) with 30-day dismiss
- ✅ **Check-in / Check-out Board** replaces dashboard roster — auto-timestamps, status dot indicator
- ✅ **Pup Report Cards** — admin uploads up to 3 photos, taps mood tags, adds note; client sees it in portal under each booking
- ✅ 30/30 backend tests passing (Sprint 1 regression + Sprint 2 new endpoints)

## Sprint 3 — Settings + Scheduling Power-ups (2026-01)
- ✅ Updated to higher-res transparent-bg logo
- ✅ **Settings panel** with 6 tabs (admin sidebar nav)
  - Hours: per-day open/close per service (business, daycare, training; boarding 24/7)
  - Capacity & Kennels: daycare cap, boarding cap, editable kennel/room list
  - Booking Rules: max advance days, cancellation cutoff hours, auto-approve toggle, credit cost per service
  - Vaccines: toggle which vaccines are required (rabies/bordetella/dhpp/lepto/flu/heartworm) + alert threshold days
  - Mood Tags: edit pill list for report cards
  - Account: change admin password
- ✅ **Recurring bookings** — clients pick start date + repeat-until + weekdays (M-S grid)
- ✅ **Drag-and-drop calendar** — admin can drag bookings to new dates (auto-rescheduled)
- ✅ **Training as a service** alongside daycare/boarding (purple chip on calendar)
- ✅ All booking logic now reads from settings (multi-vaccine, costs, capacities, auto-approve, cutoffs)
- ✅ 48/48 backend tests passing (Sprint 1+2+3 regression)
- ✅ **Mobile responsive drawer** with hamburger toggle, slide-in nav, distinct testids

## Sprint 4 — Waiver e-sign + Incident Reports + Admin Booking (2026-01)
- ✅ **Digital Waiver e-sign** — Full Sit Happens waiver text rendered with markdown-style headings; client must type their name + check accept on first portal login. Stores typed name, IP, user agent, version, full text snapshot per signature.
- ✅ **Waiver gating** — Clients cannot book until waiver is signed. Admin can bump waiver version in Settings → requires all clients to re-sign.
- ✅ **Settings → Waiver tab** to edit text, toggle required-for-booking, view all signatures.
- ✅ **Incident Report Log** — Permanent legal record with 7 types (bite/injury/escape/illness/property/behavior/other) × 3 severities, photos up to 4, witnesses, action taken, vet+follow-up flags. Filterable by type. New "Incidents" admin nav item.
- ✅ **Admin Booking Modal** — "+ New Booking" on Bookings page + "+ Quick Check-in" on Dashboard. Pick client → auto-loads their dogs → service/date/kennel/notes. Toggles for: check-in immediately, override vaccines, override capacity. All admin-only.
- ✅ Bug fix: stale auth + missing isRecurring state caused user-reported "uncaught runtime error" crash; fixed and verified.
- ✅ 61/61 backend tests passing (Sprint 1+2+3+4 regression)

## Sprint 5+7 — Daily Operations + Training Mode (2026-01)
- ✅ **Dog Profile tabs** — Dog edit modal now has 5 tabs: Basics, Vaccines, Feeding & Meds, Training, Notes & Vet
- ✅ **Feeding schedule** per dog (time, amount, food type, notes)
- ✅ **Medication schedule** per dog (name, dosage, times, with-food flag, notes)
- ✅ **Training skill tracker** — 12 default skills (Sit/Stay/Down/Place/Recall/Heel/Leave It/Wait/Loose Leash/Crate/Watch Me/Drop It) with 4 progression levels (Intro/Practicing/Reliable/Proofed). Per-skill notes.
- ✅ **Vet contact** per dog (name + phone)
- ✅ **Booking drop-off/pickup times** — Optional time fields on AdminBookingModal; persist on bookings
- ✅ **Daily Run Sheet** — Print-friendly grouped roster (boarding/daycare/training) with feeding, meds, vet contact, kennel, dropoff/pickup, owner phone, emergency contact, notes. New admin nav item with date picker + Print button (CSS print styles).
- ✅ **Dashboard check-in board** now shows feeding/medication count icons inline + kennel assignment.
- ✅ **Training Homework** — Admin assigns tasks (title, instructions, optional YouTube link, due date) to a specific dog. Client portal shows assigned homework with "Mark Done" → completion note + proof photo. Filter by status (all/assigned/completed).
- ✅ Bug fix: BookingIn was missing dropoff_time/pickup_time fields (Pydantic silently dropped them); patched and verified
- ✅ 71/71 backend tests passing (Sprint 1+2+3+4+5+7 regression)

## Sprint 6 — Client Delight + Admin Edits (2026-02)
- ✅ **Global Search (Cmd/Ctrl+K)** — fuzzy search across dogs & clients with keyboard nav (↑/↓/Enter/ESC). Backend `GET /api/search?q=…`. Clicking a result auto-opens the matching dog/client edit modal.
- ✅ **Booking Edit Mode** — `Edit` button on each Bookings row opens AdminBookingModal with existing values; supports updating notes, kennel, drop-off/pickup times via `PATCH /api/bookings/{id}`. Button label dynamically switches to "Save Changes" in edit mode.
- ✅ **Booking Conflict Detection** — `GET /api/bookings/conflicts?dog_id=…&date_str=…` returns same-day bookings; AdminBookingModal shows an orange warning panel with conflicting bookings (works in both create + edit modes).
- ✅ **Upcoming Birthdays Banner** — Dashboard shows dogs with birthdays in the next 14 days. Computed in `_upcoming_birthdays()`.
- ✅ **Multi-Photo Gallery per Dog** — New "Gallery" tab in dog edit modal. Upload multiple photos via `<input type=file multiple>`, 3-col grid, click-to-lightbox, individual delete. Persisted in `dog.photos: List[str]` (base64).
- ✅ **Dog Lifetime Stats** — `GET /api/dogs/{id}/stats` returns daycare_days / boarding_nights / training_sessions / last_visit / incidents / homework counts. Displayed as stat pills atop the dog edit modal.
- ✅ **Report Card Lightbox** — Client portal report card photos now open a full-screen lightbox with prev/next arrows + ESC close.
- ✅ **ErrorBoundary** — Wraps `<App />` with a crash boundary that offers "Clear session & reload" (removes `sh_token` + reloads) — protects against stale state crashes during deploys.
- ✅ 81/81 backend tests passing (Sprint 1-7 regression incl. 10 new Sprint 6 tests)

## Sprint 8 — Client Self-Signup + Onboarding (2026-02)
- ✅ **Auto-link client record on `/auth/register`** — registering through the portal now creates BOTH a `users` row and a linked `clients` record (email/name pre-filled), so new prospects can self-serve immediately
- ✅ **Onboarding banner** with 3-step checklist (Profile → Add Dog → Sign Waiver) — friendly tone, step indicator, gated CTAs until prior step done
- ✅ **`PortalProfileModal`** — client edits own name/address/phone/emergency contact via `PUT /api/portal/me` (keeps user.name in sync)
- ✅ **`PortalDogModal`** — client adds/edits own dog: name, breed, age, birthday, sex, fixed, vaccines (rabies/bordetella/dhpp), photo, vet, notes. Backed by new `POST /api/portal/dogs` + `PUT /api/portal/dogs/{id}` that enforce owner scope. Admin-only fields (training_skills, feeding_schedule, medications) excluded from client-editable model.
- ✅ Dog cards in portal are now clickable → reopen edit modal. "Add a Dog" prominent button.
- ✅ Waiver auto-popup deferred until client has added at least one dog (so onboarding banner controls the natural order)
- ✅ **`/app/backend/reset_db.py`** — one-shot reset script for going to production (wipes all business data, keeps admin)

## Sprint 9 — Credit Model Cleanup (2026-02)
- ✅ **Credits are now daycare-only.** Boarding and training cost `0` credits — they're pay-on-the-day.
- ✅ **No hard-block on insufficient credits.** Clients with 0 credits can still book — daycare credits deduct *up to available balance* (the rest is owed on drop-off). Admin tracks the balance manually.
- ✅ **`credits_deducted` field** added to bookings — tracks the exact amount charged so cancellations refund only what was charged (not the full nominal cost).
- ✅ Portal credit card relabeled "Daycare Credits" with explainer copy ("For daycare days · Boarding & training pay-on-the-day").
- ✅ Regression: 81/81 backend tests passing; `test_insufficient_credits` updated to assert new pay-on-the-day behavior.

## Sprint 10 — Backup & Restore (2026-02)
- ✅ **`GET /api/backup/export`** (admin only) — returns a full JSON snapshot of all business collections (clients, dogs, bookings, incidents, homework, waiver_signatures, vaccine_dismissals, settings). User accounts intentionally excluded.
- ✅ **`POST /api/backup/restore`** with two modes:
  - `merge` (safer) — upserts by `id`; leaves existing records untouched if not in backup
  - `replace` — drops each collection and bulk-inserts the backup contents
- ✅ **Settings → Backup & Restore tab** — one-click download with date-stamped filename, drag-drop file picker with preview, mode selector, confirm dialog.

## Sprint 11 — Service-Dog Training Curriculum (2026-02)
- ✅ **Command Library** — `commands` collection seeded with 36 TADSAW service-dog commands across 4 categories (Engagement, Basic Obedience, Public Access, Task-Specific). Admin-managed at Settings → Training Commands.
- ✅ **5-point score scale** — 0=Not Started, 1=Introductory, 2=Learning, 3=Emerging, 4=Proficient, 5=Mastered (replaces the old 4-level training_skills tab).
- ✅ **Per-dog curriculum** — `dog.curriculum` stores per-command level/notes/last_session_at/in_homework. Auto-created on first session log; admin can also edit any command's level directly via `PUT /api/dogs/{id}/training/{command_id}`.
- ✅ **Training Sessions** — `POST /api/dogs/{id}/training-sessions` with date, environment (home/store/park/vet/training_facility/other), distraction (1-10), scores per command, and CGC mock-pass flag. Highest score wins per command.
- ✅ **Progress summary** — overall + per-category mastery %.
- ✅ **Auto-awarded badges** — Bronze (50% engagement+obedience), Silver (80% basics + CGC mock pass), Gold (95% overall + 90% task), plus per-category Master badges at 100%.
- ✅ **Admin UI** — Dog edit modal Training tab: progress ring, per-category breakdown, grouped command tiles with level chips, edit-entry modal, Log Session modal (full multi-command scoring), Session History modal.
- ✅ **Client portal** — "Training Progress" section per dog: progress ring + category %s + earned badges + flagged "Practice This Week" homework commands with YouTube demo links + Print Certificate (print-friendly landscape HTML cert for Bronze/Silver/Gold).
- ✅ **YouTube video URL** per command (optional gold-standard demo, opens in new tab).
- ✅ Settings → Training Commands tab: full CRUD for the library (admin can add/edit/delete commands).
- ✅ 19/19 new backend tests pass, 80/81 legacy regression pass (1 pre-existing unrelated failure).

## Sprint 12 — Training Pipeline + Multi-Enrollment + Tags (2026-02)
- ✅ **Multi-tier Programs system** — `programs` collection holds reusable curriculums per type (`private_lessons`, `board_train`, `service_dog`, `custom`) with modules → goals. Goals can be **scored (1-5)** or **manual_only** (boolean done/not-done) checkbox. `completion_rule` per program. Seven seeded standard programs via `POST /api/programs/seed-standard` (idempotent).
- ✅ **Per-dog enrollments** — `dog_programs` collection. A dog can hold **multiple simultaneously active enrollments** (multi-enrollment supported — no auto-pause of prior). Each enrollment has `target_completion_date`, `notes`, `goal_progress`, and a `program_snapshot` to keep the curriculum frozen at enrollment time.
- ✅ **Status lifecycle** — `active → on_hold → withdrawn / completed` (`paused` retired in favor of `on_hold`). Goal status auto-bumps: score 5 ⇒ mastered, 1-4 ⇒ in_progress, 0 ⇒ not_started; manual_only goals toggle mastered via the `status` field directly.
- ✅ **Global Training Pipeline screen** — new admin sidebar item. `GET /api/programs/pipeline` returns every enrollment with embedded dog/client/program details; UI shows KPI tiles (Active / On Hold / Completed), filter row (status + program type + free-text search), and per-row jump-to-dog wiring (`onJumpToDog`).
- ✅ **Programs admin builder** (`Programs.jsx`) — full CRUD with goal kind selector (scored vs checkbox), completion_rule editor, default-program flag, soft delete (`active=false`).
- ✅ **DogTrainingTab multi-enrollment UI** — enroll into any program, edit target date, score/check goals inline, withdraw/complete; existing service-dog command library tab still available.
- ✅ **Dog tags** — free-form `tags: List[str]` on every dog (e.g., `service_dog_candidate`, `puppy_class`). Persisted via either `PUT /api/dogs/{id}` (full save) or the dedicated `PUT /api/dogs/{id}/tags` endpoint.
- ✅ **Bug fix**: `DogIn`/`DogOut` Pydantic models were missing the `tags` field, causing the full-form dog save to silently drop tag edits and `GET /api/dogs` to strip the field from responses. Added `tags: List[str] = []` to `DogIn` → both routes now round-trip correctly. (RCA: iteration_10 test report.)
- ✅ 122/122 backend tests passing (test_pipeline_multi_enroll.py: 22 new tests covering pipeline filters, seed idempotency, programs CRUD with mixed goal kinds, multi-enrollment proof, target_completion_date round-trip, status transitions, manual_only mastery, scored auto-bump, active-summary, tag persistence). Obsolete `test_programs.py` (iteration_9 single-enrollment schema) removed.

## Backlog / Next Iterations (Prioritized)
**P1**
- Boarding capacity rule (currently only daycare enforces capacity)
- DogTrainingTab interactive smoke test (add enrollment, change target date, toggle manual_only checkbox) — backend covered, UI interactions only static-reviewed
- Vaccine expiry alerts banner on admin dashboard with click-to-dog

**P2**
- Custom `completion_rule` auto-trigger logic (UI exists; automation pending — programs.completion_rule should auto-mark enrollment `completed` when criteria hit)
- Tag-based filters across Pipeline / Dogs / Run Sheet
- CSV export of bookings/clients
- Run-sheet `active_program_name` picks the *first* enrollment; consider showing all or most-recent when a dog has multiple actives
- Stripe credit pack purchases via client portal

**P3**
- `server.py` refactor (~2300 lines → split into `/app/backend/routes/`)
- Multi-staff accounts with audit log
- Per-service pricing (vs flat credit cost)

## Sprint 13 — Installable PWA (2026-02)
- ✅ **`manifest.webmanifest`** — name "Sit Happens", short_name "Sit Happens", theme `#8cc63f`, background `#0f172a`, display `standalone`, scope `/`.
- ✅ **Icon set generated from existing `/public/logo.png`** (735×693 RGBA) onto solid slate-900 canvas: `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`, `icon-maskable-512.png` (22% safe zone for adaptive shapes), `apple-touch-icon.png` (180×180), `favicon-64.png`.
- ✅ **`service-worker.js`** — versioned cache (`sh-v1`), shell pre-cached, network-first strategy for static assets (so new deploys take effect immediately when online) and offline fallback to cached shell. `/api/*` and cross-origin always bypass the cache. Auto-skip-waiting on update + `controllerchange` triggers a single page reload.
- ✅ **iOS PWA meta tags** — `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, status-bar style `black-translucent`, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`, `viewport-fit=cover`. App title used by iOS install: "Sit Happens".
- ✅ **`InstallPrompt.jsx`** — listens for `beforeinstallprompt` (Chrome/Edge/Android) and renders a bottom-left pill with brand icon, "Install" + "Later" buttons. Dismissal persisted for 14 days in localStorage. iOS Safari gets a passive hint ("Share → Add to Home Screen") since iOS doesn't support programmatic install. Auto-hides when `display-mode: standalone`.
- ✅ **Service worker registered in `index.js`** — only on `https:` (skips dev). Manifest, SW, and icon endpoints all returning 200; SW activated and controlling the page.
- ✅ **`InstallAppButton` + `useInstallPrompt` hook** — manual install button in admin sidebar AND client portal header. Triggers native prompt if ready, or a styled howto modal with platform-specific steps (iOS vs desktop).

## Sprint 14 — Homework Templates Library + Per-Section Logging (2026-02)
- ✅ **10 ready-to-assign templates** seeded via `POST /api/homework-templates/seed-standard` (idempotent, slug-keyed upsert):
  - **Tier 1 · Foundation**: The First 48 Hours, Basic Obedience — Part 1, Door Manners & Impulse Control
  - **Tier 2 · Intermediate**: Structured Walk Mastery, Duration & Distance, Correcting Nuisance Behaviors
  - **Tier 3 · Advanced**: Bulletproof Recall, Off-Leash Fundamentals
  - **Specialty**: Public Access Prep
  - **Customizable Master Template** for on-the-fly assignments
- ✅ **Structured schema** — each template has `global_rules_this_week`, multiple **sections**, each section has **fields** (kinds: `reps`, `sets`, `duration_sec`, `duration_min`, `distance_ft`, `success_rate`, `rating_5`, `checkbox`, `text`, `longtext`) with optional `target` and `reverse` flag for "lower is better" metrics.
- ✅ **Backend endpoints**: full CRUD on `/api/homework-templates`, `POST /api/homework/from-template` (freezes template_snapshot + auto due-date from `default_duration_days`), `POST /api/homework/{id}/section-log` (validates section_id), `DELETE /api/homework/{id}/section-log/{log_id}`, `GET /api/homework/{id}/report` (per-section, per-field aggregations: total / avg / max / min / trend / count + checkbox yes_count + text latest).
- ✅ **`customized` flag** on system templates — admin edits via PUT mark `customized=True` so future `seed-standard` runs skip them. PUT also strips `is_default`/`active` to prevent silent reactivation.
- ✅ **Trend computation** — split-half compare; up/down/flat. Reverse fields flip the visual semantics.
- ✅ **Admin UI** (`Homework.jsx`): green "Assign from Template" + blue "+ Custom". Picker (`HomeworkTemplatePicker.jsx`) groups templates by tier with branded colors. Detail view shows tier badge, description, House Rules, collapsible section preview, override fields. Each assigned row has tier-colored badge + "View report" toggle.
- ✅ **`HomeworkReportPanel.jsx`** — per-section stat tiles with avg + total + trend arrow + goal-hit indicator.
- ✅ **Client UI** (`Portal.jsx` + `HomeworkSectionLogger.jsx`): templated homework expands to show House Rules banner + per-section cards. "+ Log a session" reveals structured form. Counters refresh on save (verified 1→2 via screenshot). View-history accordion lists past entries.
- ✅ **140/140 backend tests passing** (122 prior + 18 new homework-template tests).

## Sprint 15 — Tutorials / How-to (2026-02)
- ✅ **`Tutorials.jsx`** — single role-aware component (`role="admin" | "client"`) renders 6 admin sections (Getting Started, Clients & Dogs, Bookings & Schedule, Training Programs & Pipeline, Homework Forms, Operations & Data) and 5 client sections (Getting Started, Booking, Training Homework, Training Progress, Account & Profile). Each section has multiple cards with numbered steps and optional pro-tips in an orange-accent box.
- ✅ **Live search** across all tutorial content (filters cards, hides empty sections).
- ✅ **Admin access**: new "How to Use" sidebar item (with `fa-circle-question` icon) loads in-place like any other admin tab.
- ✅ **Client access**: blue "How to Use" button in the portal header opens a full-screen overlay with a sticky close header — no navigation away from the portal.
- ✅ Pure content, no backend calls. Lint clean.

## Sprint 16 — Services Catalog + Income Tracking (2026-02)
- ✅ **`services` collection** (new) seeded with 7 standard offerings via `POST /api/services/seed-standard` (idempotent): Daycare (per day) $35, Boarding (per night) $55, 1-on-1 Private Lesson $90, Board & Train (per week) $1500, Service Dog Evaluation $150, Bath $45, Nail Trim $20. Color + icon + service_type per row.
- ✅ **CRUD on `/api/services`** — admin can add custom services, edit any service (name/price/type/icon), and remove (soft-delete for `is_default`, hard-delete otherwise). PUT strips immutable `slug` and server-managed `is_default`.
- ✅ **`bookings` table extended** with `service_id`, `service_name`, `actual_price`, `payment_status` (unpaid/paid/refunded/comped), `payment_method` (cash/card/transfer/credits/other), `paid_at` — backward-compatible (all optional).
- ✅ **`POST /api/transactions`** — quick-log endpoint for walk-ins or one-off lessons. Creates a booking row tagged with service + price in one call; falls back to `service.base_price` when `actual_price` is null.
- ✅ **`PUT /api/transactions/{id}`** — inline edits (price / payment_status / payment_method / service_id). Two automations baked in: setting `payment_status="paid"` auto-stamps `paid_at` AND flips `status→completed`; swapping `service_id` refreshes `service_name` and only auto-syncs price if existing price was 0 (preserves admin overrides).
- ✅ **`GET /api/transactions`** — revenue-bearing rows by default (any row with `service_id` OR `actual_price`). `?revenue_only=false` includes legacy unpriced bookings for backfill. Filters: dog_id, service_id, status, payment_status, start_date/end_date.
- ✅ **`GET /api/transactions/weekly-summary`** — current Mon→Sun tally with `completed_total` / `paid_total` / `unpaid_total` / `booked_total` + counts + by_service breakdown + `credits_redeemed`. `?ref_date=YYYY-MM-DD` jumps to any other week.
- ✅ **`GET /api/transactions/summary-range`** — arbitrary date range with `by_day` series for monthly / quarterly views.
- ✅ **Auto-tally on check-out** — `POST /api/bookings/{id}/check-out` now auto-attaches the matching default `service.base_price` + `payment_status="unpaid"` if the booking has no price yet. The "automation when service is completed" the user asked about.
- ✅ **Admin UI** — new **Income** sidebar tab (`fa-dollar-sign`). Page header buttons (Export CSV / Log Service); 4 weekly tiles (Completed / Paid / Unpaid / Booked-upcoming); by-service breakdown chips; week navigator (◀ / date-picker / ▶ / Today); spreadsheet-style table with inline editable price / service / payment_status / payment_method per row; filters by dog / service / payment / status + search; "Include unpriced" toggle for legacy data; CSV export.
- ✅ **Log Service modal** — type-to-search dog picker, service dropdown auto-fills price, override price field, date/status/payment/method, notes.
- ✅ **Settings → Services & Prices** tab — full CRUD on the catalog with optional "Seed Standard 7" button for empty state.
- ✅ **Testing** — 24/25 Sprint 16 backend tests pass (1 environmental skip on the auto-tally test). 140/140 prior regression still pass. Frontend smoke-tested end-to-end via Playwright by the testing agent (100% Sprint 16 flows verified).

## Sprint 17 — Credit Packs (FIFO Lots) + Multi-Date Bookings + Monthly/Quarterly Income (2026-02)
- ✅ **`credit_packs` collection** seeded with 4 defaults via `POST /api/credit-packs/seed-standard`: Single Day $35 (1 credit), 5-Pack $160 ($32/credit), 10-Pack $300 ($30/credit), 20-Pack $550 ($27.50/credit). Full CRUD; per-credit value computed on the fly.
- ✅ **`credit_lots` collection** — every pack sold creates a FIFO lot tagged with `qty_total`, `qty_remaining`, `value_each` (per-credit cost from the pack), `pack_id`, `purchased_at`. Booking approvals consume oldest lot first; cancellations restore.
- ✅ **`POST /api/clients/{id}/sell-pack`** — admin sells a pack; increments client.credits AND creates the lot. **No income event** (revenue is recognized at redemption, not at purchase — per user's accounting preference).
- ✅ **Income recognition at check-out** — `_consume_credit_lots()` helper FIFO-consumes lots when bookings are approved, stamping `credit_value` on each booking (the per-credit cost from the consumed lot). `POST /api/bookings/{id}/check-out` then promotes `credit_value → actual_price` with `payment_status="paid"` and `payment_method="credits"`. The booking now appears in the weekly income tally.
- ✅ **Cancellation rollback** — cancelling an approved daycare booking refunds the credit balance AND restores `qty_remaining` on the lot it consumed from (via `_restore_credit_lots()`).
- ✅ **`POST /api/bookings/multi-dates`** — single API call creates one booking per date for "pick exact days" (e.g., Monday this week + Tuesday next week). Each date independently validates capacity/vaccines/waiver and returns `{created: [...], skipped: [{date, reason}]}` so the client sees exactly which days were blocked.
- ✅ **Settings → Credit Packs** UI — full CRUD with per-credit value live-preview and a "Seed Standard 4" empty-state button.
- ✅ **Clients page** — new "Sell Credit Pack" green button on each client card; opens a modal with pack picker (showing qty + price + per-credit), payment method, optional note, live "Credits +N / Charge $X / Value/credit $Y" preview tiles.
- ✅ **Client portal Book Service card** — new "Pick specific days" toggle (mutually exclusive with "Recurring weekdays"); reveals a two-month forward calendar grid with disabled-past, today highlighted, tap-to-toggle days. Selected days chip-row at bottom with × to remove individuals + "Clear all".
- ✅ **Income screen — Longer-Range View** — Month / Quarter / YTD / Custom preset chips, 3 KPI tiles (Completed / Paid / Avg-per-active-day), daily bar chart (`by_day` series from `summary-range` endpoint).
- ✅ **164/164 backend tests passing** (24 new Sprint 17 tests covering pack CRUD, FIFO consumption, lot rollback on cancel, multi-date validation + skip reporting, income recognition timing).

## Sprint 18 — Training Credit Packs (2026-02)
- ✅ **`clients.training_credits` field** (new, defaults 0) — separate pool from daycare `credits`. Both round-trip through ClientIn/ClientOut.
- ✅ **4 training pack defaults seeded**: Single 1-on-1 Lesson $90, 3-Session Pack $250 ($83.33/credit), 5-Session Pack $400 ($80/credit), 10-Session Pack $750 ($75/credit). All editable in Settings → Credit Packs.
- ✅ **`_consume_credit_lots()` is now service-type-aware** — FIFO consumption filters lots by `service_type` so daycare credits and training credits stay in their own pools. No cross-contamination.
- ✅ **Sell-pack endpoint routes by `pack.service_type`** — training packs increment `training_credits`, daycare packs increment `credits`. Each lot is tagged with its service_type for FIFO tracking.
- ✅ **Booking approval logic** — `service_type=="training"` deducts 1 from `training_credits` (1 session = 1 credit, regardless of `cost` field). Daycare keeps existing `cost`-based deduction. Cancellation refunds the correct pool via `booking.credit_service_type`.
- ✅ **Income recognition unchanged** — training credit redemption flows through the same accrue-at-approval / recognize-at-check-out pattern. Check-out promotes `credit_value → actual_price` regardless of pool.
- ✅ **Frontend Clients page** — every client card now shows **Daycare** (green) + **Training** (purple) credit balances side-by-side. Sell Pack modal got a `[All / Daycare / Training]` filter row + service-type-colored preview tiles.
- ✅ **Settings → Credit Packs** — new "Pool" dropdown (Daycare credits / Training credits) when creating/editing custom packs. Catalog rows color-code service_type pill (green for daycare, purple for training).
- ✅ **Client portal** — credit card split into two tiles: "Daycare · days remaining" (green) and "Training · sessions remaining" (purple).
- ✅ **Payment method enum extended** — added `check` to support paper-check tracking on pack sales.

## Sprint 19 — Admin Email Alerts + Photo Fit (2026-02)
- ✅ **Dog photos display in full** — main dog card hero, gallery thumbnails, and portal dog cards now use `object-contain` with a bgBase letterbox so uploaded photos are never cropped. Lightbox already showed full image.
- ✅ **Admin email notifications** wired through Resend (best-effort, non-blocking) for four client-triggered events:
  - New client account registration (`/api/auth/register`)
  - New booking from portal — already existed (`POST /api/bookings`)
  - Homework session log by a client (`POST /api/homework/{id}/section-log`)
  - Homework completion by a client (`POST /api/homework/{id}/complete`)
- ✅ All notifications skip self-triggered admin actions (only fire when `user.role != "admin"`) and never raise — failures are logged but never break the underlying flow.
- ✅ Smoke-tested via curl on `/api/auth/register` — Resend confirmed delivery to `sithappensohio@gmail.com`.

## Sprint 20 — Client Alerts: Homework + Low Credits (2026-02)
- ✅ **Homework-assigned email to client** — fires from both `POST /api/homework` (custom) and `POST /api/homework/from-template`. Email includes dog, title, due date, assigned-by, and trimmed instructions preview.
- ✅ **Low-credit heads-up email** — fires on credit deduction (both `POST /api/bookings` admin auto-approve path and `POST /api/bookings/{id}/approve`) when the balance crosses from `>2` to `≤2`. Pool-aware (Daycare vs Training) so each pack threshold notifies independently. Crossing-only logic prevents repeat spam at 1 and 0 credits.
- ✅ Smoke-tested: assigning a homework triggered the client email, and approving a booking that took credits from 3→2 triggered the low-credit email. Both delivered through Resend successfully.

## Sprint 21 — Bulk Credit Pack Sales (2026-02)
- ✅ **`POST /api/clients/{id}/sell-packs`** — new bulk endpoint accepts `items: [{pack_id, quantity}]` plus shared `payment_method` + `note`. Pre-validates every pack id, then mints one `credit_lot` per pack qty (so FIFO/redemption math is unchanged) and bumps `credits` / `training_credits` in a single `$inc`. Returns `lots[]`, per-pool totals, total_price, and lots_created count.
- ✅ **Payment-method enum on sell endpoints** now includes `check` (was already in the frontend, just missed in single-pack validator).
- ✅ **Sell-Pack modal redesign (Clients page)** — tap-to-add pack list with `×N` badge, full cart panel with `−` / `+` / `×` controls per line, live totals split into Daycare vs Training pools, dynamic CTA showing total credits + dollar amount (e.g., *"Sell · +3 credits · $160.00"*).
- ✅ Old single-pack endpoint kept for backward compat; new bulk endpoint is the one the UI calls.
- ✅ Smoke-tested: 2× Single Day Drop-In ($35) + 1× 5-Day Daycare Pack ($160) → client credits 10 → 17, $230 total, 3 lots created, mongo state verified.

## Sprint 22 — Sale Receipts (Emailed + Printable) (2026-02)
- ✅ **Bulk-sell endpoint now returns a `receipt` object** with `client_name`, `client_email`, `lines[]` (name, qty, unit_price, line_total, service_type, pack_qty), `totals`, `total_price`, `payment_method`, `note`, `sold_by`, `sold_at`.
- ✅ **Resend email receipt to client** — fires automatically (best-effort, non-blocking) after every pack sale. Branded HTML with line items, per-pool credits added, grand total, payment method, "Credits never expire" footer, and a portal CTA.
- ✅ **In-app printable receipt modal** — after a successful sale the Sell-Pack modal closes and a "Sale Complete" receipt modal opens with line-item table, pool breakdown chips, grand total in big shGreen, payment method, note, and "Print Receipt" CTA. Built with `window.print()` + a dedicated `@media print` rule in `index.css` that hides everything except `[data-testid="pack-receipt"]` and applies a clean white/black print theme.
- ✅ No expiration column (user confirmed packs don't expire — receipt explicitly says "Credits never expire").
- ✅ Smoke-tested via UI: 2× Single Day Drop-In + 1× Single 1-on-1 Lesson → modal shows both rows, $160 total, +2 daycare / +1 training, and Resend logs confirm receipt email delivered to client.

## Sprint 23 — Historical Receipts Tab (2026-02)
- ✅ **`GET /api/clients/{id}/receipts`** — groups `credit_lots` by `(purchased_at, payment_method, sold_by, note)` so each bulk-sale transaction becomes one receipt row. Lots from the same pack are aggregated into a single line (qty × unit_price = line_total) and totals split into daycare/training pools. Returns the exact same shape as the post-sale receipt response, so the existing `ReceiptModal` reuses cleanly.
- ✅ **"Receipts" button on every client card** (under "Sell Credit Pack") opens a `ReceiptsListModal` showing each historical sale with date, item count, pack count, payment method, sold-by, pool chips (+N daycare / +N training), note preview, total dollars, and a per-row **Reprint** button.
- ✅ Clicking Reprint pipes the saved receipt object into the same `ReceiptModal` used post-sale, so the printable layout and `window.print()` flow is identical to a brand-new receipt.
- ✅ `Modal` component now accepts an optional `maxWidth` prop (defaults to `max-w-md`) so the wider receipts list (`max-w-lg`) renders comfortably without breaking other modals.
- ✅ Smoke-tested: created 2 fresh sales for a client, plus one pre-existing lot — endpoint correctly returns 3 grouped receipts in newest-first order; UI shows all rows with correct totals, pool chips and notes.

## Sprint 24 — Professional Polish (Q1 2026)
- ✅ **QR install footer in client emails** — every client-facing Resend email (booking confirmed, homework assigned, low credits, pack receipt, etc.) now includes a 110×110 QR code linking to the app + iOS / Android install instructions. Admin notifications skip the footer (you already use the app).
- ✅ **`qrcode` library** added to requirements.txt + inline base64 PNG generation cached in-memory per URL so no extra latency on repeat sends.
- ✅ **Stale-token auto-clear** — `axios` response interceptor in `/app/frontend/src/lib/api.js` watches for 401 responses and removes the bad JWT from localStorage + redirects to `/`. ErrorBoundary already in place handles full crashes.
- ✅ **Auto-complete training enrollments** — new `_auto_complete_if_satisfied()` helper fires after every goal update (`PUT /dogs/{id}/programs/{eid}/goals/{gid}`) and every training log (`POST /dogs/{id}/training-logs`). Evaluates the enrollment's `completion_rule.type` (`percent` / `all_mastered` / `manual` / `sessions`) and flips status → completed when satisfied; stamps `auto_completed=true`, `completed_at`, and rotates the dog's `active_program_id` to the next active enrollment if any.
- ✅ **Backend test pollution fixed** — `TEST_DATE_OFFSET = random.randint(20, 40)` rolled at module import; all hard-coded `date.today() + timedelta(days=N)` in TestBookings replaced with `_future_date(N)` so consecutive runs don't collide with leftover Boarding bookings. Stays under `booking_rules.max_advance_days=60`.
- ✅ Testing agent verified: 25/25 targeted tests pass, 163/164 full regression (1 transient HTTPS timeout, retry green). Email send verified through Resend with new QR footer.

## Sprint 25 — Performance Optimisation (2026-02)
- ✅ **MongoDB indexes added** on hot query paths: `bookings.(date, status)`, `bookings.dog_id`, `bookings.client_id`, `dogs.owner_id`, `homework.(status, created_at desc)`, `dog_programs.(dog_id, status)`, `credit_lots.(client_id, purchased_at desc)`, `credit_lots.(client_id, service_type, qty_remaining)`. Idempotent — running again is a no-op.
- ✅ **`/api/bookings` date-windowed** by default to last 90d + future 90d. New params: `start_date`, `end_date`, `include_all=true` (for CSV export / reconciliation). Backward compatible — no frontend changes needed.
- ✅ **`/api/dogs` strips gallery photos** from list responses (base64 arrays can be MBs per dog). Each card still gets the main `photo` thumbnail. New `GET /api/dogs/{id}` endpoint returns the full record with gallery — used by the edit modal which now fires `Promise.all([fullDog, stats])` so the modal still opens snappily.
- ✅ **`/api/dashboard/stats` projection** drops `photo`, `photos`, `training_logs` from roster dogs (kept `feeding_schedule` + `medications` + `training_skills` so dashboard care-icons keep rendering). Restricted booking query to a tight window (today ± 60d back / 1d forward) instead of every booking.
- ✅ **`/api/programs/pipeline` N+1 → 2 queries** — batch-loads dogs and clients with `$in` then joins in memory instead of N+1 round trips. Measured: 360ms → 135ms (2.6× faster).
- ✅ Testing agent verified: **194/195 tests pass**, one stale test rolled back after restoring `feeding_schedule`/`medications` to the dashboard projection (the dashboard's care-icon badges need them).

## Sprint 26 — Client-Side Image Compression (2026-02)
- ✅ **`/app/frontend/src/lib/imageCompress.js`** — single utility resizes uploaded photos via `<canvas>` to max 1600×1600 and re-encodes as JPEG q=0.82 before base64-storing. Non-images (PDFs, SVG) pass through untouched. Small photos (<400 KB and under the size cap) skip recompression. Decode failures fall back to the original so an exotic format never breaks upload.
- ✅ **Wired into 6 upload sites**: Dogs main photo + gallery, Portal homework photo, Portal new-dog modal photo, Dashboard report card photos (×3), Incidents photos (×4).
- ✅ **Expected savings**: a typical 4 MB iPhone photo becomes ~150-300 KB stored — **10-20× smaller** with no visible quality loss. Dog gallery downloads now stay snappy even with 5+ photos per dog at scale.
- ✅ Pre-existing dead code at the tail of `Portal.jsx` (lines 565-570 leftover from earlier merge) cleaned up.

## Sprint 27 — Photo Backfill + Tolerant Index Creation (2026-02)
- ✅ **`/app/backend/photo_backfill.py`** — Pillow-based async backfill that scans `dogs`, `bookings.report_card`, and `incidents`, decodes base64 photos, resizes to ≤1600px, re-encodes as JPEG q=82. Photos under ~350 KB are skipped (idempotent). Tracks scanned/compressed/skipped/errors + bytes saved in module-level state.
- ✅ **`POST /api/admin/compress-photos`** — admin-only, kicks off the backfill as an `asyncio.create_task` so the API stays responsive. Re-running while a job is active is a no-op.
- ✅ **`GET /api/admin/compress-photos/status`** — poll endpoint returning current stage, counts, mb_saved.
- ✅ **`PhotoCompressionPanel` in Settings → Backup & Restore** — purple "Shrink Existing Photos" section with stats grid (Scanned / Compressed / Skipped / Space saved MB), running spinner, polling status every 1.5s, confirmation modal, and a re-run button that's safe to press again later.
- ✅ **Tolerant index creation on startup** — each perf index wrapped in its own `try/except` so one malformed legacy index never aborts the entire backend boot (defensive fix prompted by the slow-deploy observation).
- ✅ **Verified**: injected a 3.9 MB synthetic JPEG onto Buddy → ran backfill → photo dropped to 330 KB (**16× smaller**) in 180 ms. UI panel shows "Saved 4.9 MB across 1 photos" on completion.

## Sprint 28 — Lazy Image Loading (2026-02)
- ✅ Added `loading="lazy" decoding="async"` to **12 photo `<img>` tags** across Dogs (card hero, gallery thumbs, edit form preview), Portal (dog cards, homework photo, report card photos), Dashboard (report card preview), Pipeline (avatar), Incidents (card + edit form), Homework (completion photo), and PortalDogModal.
- ✅ Skipped static brand assets (`/logo.png`, `/icon-192.png`, made-with-emergent badge) and the Lightbox modal — those are tiny / above-the-fold / only visible after explicit user interaction.
- ✅ Browser now only downloads photos as they scroll into view, eliminating the burst of 20-30 simultaneous image requests on first paint of Dogs / Pipeline / Bookings screens.

## Sprint 29 — Smart Check-out + Cancel-with-Refund (2026-02)
- ✅ **`POST /api/bookings/{id}/check-out`** rewritten to accept an optional `CheckoutIn` body: `use_credits`, `payment_method`, `payment_status`, `base_price`, `add_ons[]`. Calling with no body keeps the previous default (consume credits, no add-ons) so legacy callers are untouched.
- ✅ **"Use credits" path**: credits stay deducted, `actual_price = credit_value`, `payment_method = credits`, income tally records the redemption.
- ✅ **"Refund + charge" path**: `_restore_credit_lots()` puts the credit back on the pack, `client.credits` is incremented, `credit_value` cleared, booking gets `actual_price + payment_method = cash/card/check/etc.`
- ✅ **Add-on services at check-out**: each `{service_id, name, price, qty}` is logged as a line item on the booking and added to `actual_price`. Bath / nail trim / any other configured service can be tacked on with one tap.
- ✅ **`CheckoutModal`** (new) on Dashboard: radio for credits-vs-charge (only shown when credits exist), grid of add-on chips with +/- counters, payment method + optional base-price override, live total preview broken down into Base / Add-ons / Charged today.
- ✅ **Cancel-with-refund**: existing `DELETE /bookings/{id}` already refunds credits when status is "approved" (which is still the case after check-in — only check-out flips to "completed"). Added two cancel surfaces on the frontend: (a) a dedicated **Cancel** button next to **Check Out** on the dashboard roster, (b) a red **"Cancel booking instead"** link inside the CheckoutModal for the "wait, I made a mistake" moment.
- ✅ End-to-end verified: client 10 credits → quick check-in (9) → cancel → **10 credits + lot.qty_remaining restored** simultaneously.

## Sprint 30 — In-App Cancel Modal (sandbox-safe) (2026-02)
- ✅ **Diagnosed:** The Sprint 29 cancel buttons used `window.confirm()`, which the Emergent preview iframe silently auto-dismisses to `false` for sandbox security — making the cancel appear to "do nothing" even though no JS error fires.
- ✅ **Replaced** both cancel surfaces with a custom in-app `<CancelBookingModal />` (z-index 60 so it stacks above the Check-out modal). Shows a red icon header, "Cancel booking?" copy, a green chip listing exactly which credits will be refunded (or a quiet "no credits to refund" note when zero), and **Keep it** / **Yes, cancel it** buttons.
- ✅ The Check-out modal's "Cancel booking instead" link now requests the parent component to swap modals: `setCheckoutFor(null); setCancelFor(b);` so the user gets the same confirm UX from either entry point.
- ✅ Smoke-tested in the actual preview iframe via Playwright: `Cancel button → modal opens → confirm → DELETE 200 → modal closes → roster row removed`.

## Sprint 48 — Portal feature pack: loyalty badges, refer-a-friend, vaccine self-upload, quick links (2026-02)
- ✅ **Settings → Portal Links** (`PortalLinksPanel`): editable URLs for your website and photo gallery host. Backend wires through `client_portal_links` field on settings doc + default block + nested backfill + `/api/settings/public`.
- ✅ **Loyalty visit badges**: `/api/portal/me` extended to return `visit_counts` (per-dog completed-booking count via a single Mongo aggregation). Portal dog cards now show a green "🏆 N visits" pill next to the breed when count > 0.
- ✅ **Refer a Friend**: `/api/portal/me` mints a 6-char `referral_code` on first call and stores it on the client doc. New `<ReferFriendModal>` shows the code in big orange type with one-tap **Text / Email / Copy** actions that pre-fill a sharable message + a `?ref=CODE` URL. Admin-side helpers added: `GET /api/referrals/lookup/{code}` to validate a code and `POST /api/clients/{id}/credit-referral` to comp a daycare day to the referrer (writes both a `referrals` audit entry and a `credit_adjustments` entry).
- ✅ **Vaccine expiry self-upload**: each portal dog card now detects vaccines expired OR within 30 days; renders a red "🛡️ N vaccines need updating" footer with an Upload button. `<VaccineUploadModal>` takes a date + compressed photo, POSTs to new `/api/portal/dogs/{id}/vaccine-update` endpoint which updates the expiry immediately (unblocking the client from booking) and stores the photo under `vaccine_certs` for later admin review.
- ✅ **Quick Links section** on Portal: pill-button list with the website / gallery / refer-a-friend entries; hidden entirely if all three are blank.
- ✅ Verified end-to-end at 390×844: quick links section renders all 3 entries; clicking Refer opens modal with code `7KTUMQ`; share buttons work; loyalty badge will appear automatically as clients complete bookings.

## Sprint 47 — Boarding pack UI + seed defaults (2026-02)
- ✅ **Seed data** (`credit_packs_data.py`): added 3 boarding packs to `SEED_CREDIT_PACKS` — single $55, 5-night $250, 10-night $475.
- ✅ **Settings → Credit Packs** (`CreditPacksSettings.jsx`): new "Boarding nights" option in the pool dropdown; chip color uses `text-shOrange` to match the rest of the app. Seed button now shows always (label flips to "Add Missing Defaults" when packs already exist) so existing installs get the 3 new boarding packs idempotently.
- ✅ **Sell Pack modal** (`Clients.jsx`): added "Boarding" filter chip, refactored pack-row color/unit logic to support 3 pools (sessions / nights / credits), cart summary expanded from 3 to 4 columns (Daycare / Training / Boarding / Charge).
- ✅ **Receipt** (`ReceiptModal`): per-line unit label now branches on boarding ("boarding nights"); totals grid shows the third pool when present.
- ✅ Verified end-to-end: seed endpoint added 3 boarding packs, Sell modal filters/cart/totals all render correctly with boarding pool.

## Sprint 46 — Boarding credits + manual credit adjustments (2026-02)
- ✅ **Boarding now uses the credit pool**: new `boarding_credits` field on the client doc (1 credit = 1 night). Helper `_credit_balance_field(service_type)` centralises the daycare/training/boarding → field mapping. Every existing call site (booking create, approve-booking, cancel-with-refund, check-out toggle, single sell-pack, bulk sell-pack) routed through the helper so boarding behaves exactly like daycare for FIFO consumption + refunds.
- ✅ **Bulk sell-packs** (`sell_credit_packs_bulk`): generalised to a 3-pool increment dict (`daycare`/`training`/`boarding`) — packs with `service_type: "boarding"` now mint proper lots and bump the right balance.
- ✅ **New endpoints** (`server.py`):
  - `POST /api/clients/{id}/adjust-credits` — `{daycare, training, boarding, note}` with signed deltas. Refuses negatives that'd take a balance below zero. Writes a `credit_adjustments` collection entry (before/delta/after per pool + note + admin name + timestamp) for audit.
  - `GET /api/clients/{id}/credit-adjustments` — list the audit log.
- ✅ **Frontend**:
  - Client card credit grid now shows **Daycare/Training/Boarding/Portal** (4 cols on `sm:`, stacked 2x2 on phones). Boarding uses `text-shOrange` for consistent color coding.
  - New "± Adjust Credits" button between Sell Pack and Receipts on every client card.
  - `<AdjustCreditsModal>` with live preview ("Current X → New Y"), red highlight if the proposed value would go negative, +/- step buttons, manual number input, required note, save-disabled when nothing changed or anything's negative.
  - Portal credit card + ClientPortalPreview both updated to a 3-col display showing all three pools.
- ✅ End-to-end verified: API call adjusts Alex Owner's daycare 9→12 with note logged, audit log returns the entry, UI grid + modal preview match.

## Sprint 45 — Hotfix: portal-snapshot decorator lost during marketing-qr insert (2026-02)
- ✅ When inserting the marketing-qr endpoint above the portal-snapshot endpoint, the `@api.get("/admin/clients/{client_id}/portal-snapshot")` decorator got accidentally consumed by the search/replace — the function body remained but it was no longer wired to a route, so the snapshot endpoint silently returned FastAPI's default 404.
- ✅ Restored the decorator. Verified preview: snapshot for Alex Owner returns full payload (1 dog, 1 booking, waiver signed). Production needs a redeploy to clear the same bug.

## Sprint 44 — Downloadable marketing QR code (2026-02)
- ✅ **Backend** (`server.py`): new admin endpoint `GET /api/admin/marketing-qr?size=N&ref=tag`. Generates a high-error-correction PNG QR pointing at `APP_PUBLIC_URL`, optional `?ref=` query param baked into the encoded URL for future scan analytics. Returns the PNG as `attachment` with a friendly filename and an `X-QR-Target-Url` header so the UI can show what's encoded.
- ✅ **Frontend** (`Settings.jsx`): new "Marketing QR" tab with a `MarketingQRPanel` component. Live PNG preview, debounced tracking-tag input (regenerates preview as you type), three download buttons (Small 512px / Print 1024px / Poster 2048px) sized for different print use cases. Uses `responseType: "blob"` + `URL.createObjectURL` + auto-clicked anchor for the download.
- ✅ Initial JSX nesting bug (MarketingQRPanel ended up inside WaiverPanel because of a missing close brace + orphan brace) caught and fixed.
- ✅ Verified end-to-end: preview renders, ref input updates the encoded URL live (`https://sit-happens-crm.emergent.host?ref=flyer`), all 3 download sizes serve correct content-disposition headers.

## Sprint 43 — "Preview as client" read-only portal viewer (2026-02)
- ✅ **Backend** (`server.py`): new admin endpoint `GET /api/admin/clients/{client_id}/portal-snapshot`. Single aggregated payload — `{client, dogs, bookings, enrollments_by_dog, homework, waiver, waiver_required}`. Read-only, no state changes. Same data shape Portal.jsx fetches but pulled by client_id instead of from the JWT.
- ✅ **Frontend component** (`components/ClientPortalPreview.jsx`): full-screen modal with a red "VIEWING AS {Name} (READ-ONLY)" banner + "Return to Admin" button. Shows credits tiles, waiver status, My Dogs cards, Upcoming bookings, Training Progress rings, Homework list, and Recent visits. No interactive controls — admin can't book/sign/edit on the client's behalf.
- ✅ **Wired** into `Clients.jsx`: each client card now has a blue "👁 Preview Client Portal" button at the top. Tap → opens the modal.
- ✅ Verified end-to-end at 1440×900 and 390×844: clicking Alex Owner's preview shows their actual credits (10/5), waiver status, Buddy dog card, and recent cancelled booking — exactly what Alex would see.

## Sprint 42 — Collapsible descriptions + editable service info (2026-02)
- ✅ **`CollapsibleText` component** (`components/CollapsibleText.jsx`): single-line preview + inline "More" toggle. Used wherever short blurbs would otherwise wrap into 8-line vertical walls on mobile.
- ✅ **Training program card** (`DogTrainingTab.jsx`): the "focus" description was wrapping into a tall narrow column on phones (visible in user's screenshot). Now: header restructured to keep ProgressRing/title/buttons on a single row; description sits below in a collapsible single line with a "More" toggle.
- ✅ **Client portal training card** (`PortalTrainingCard.jsx`): same `CollapsibleText` treatment so clients see a tidy summary instead of an 8-line wall.
- ✅ **Settings → Service Info tab** (new `ServiceInfoPanel` in `Settings.jsx`): 4 editable textareas (daycare/boarding/training/grooming) saved to `service_descriptions` on the settings doc. Backend (`server.py`) adds the new field to `_default_settings`, `SettingsIn`, the nested-backfill block, and `/api/settings/public`. `Portal.jsx`'s `ServiceInfoModal` now reads `pubSettings.service_descriptions[type]` with a hardcoded fallback.
- ✅ End-to-end verified at 390×844: enrollment card shows 2 collapsible focus rows with "More" toggles, Settings → Service Info renders 4 textareas pre-populated with defaults.

## Sprint 41 — Mobile polish: sticky CTA, pull-to-refresh, safe-area, service info (2026-02)
- ✅ **Service info modal** (`Portal.jsx`): added `SERVICE_INFO` constant + `<ServiceInfoModal>`. Each service-type pill on the portal now has a small ⓘ icon — tap to open a bottom-sheet description with a summary + 4 bullet points. Keeps the booking form short.
- ✅ **Sticky mobile "Book Service" CTA** (`Portal.jsx`): `fixed bottom-0 md:hidden` bar with `pb-safe`. Tapping smooth-scrolls to `#portal-book-section`. Scroll area gets `pb-24 md:pb-8` so content never hides behind it.
- ✅ **Pull-to-refresh hook** (`usePullToRefresh.js`): new touch-only hook + `<RefreshSpinner>`. Tracks vertical pull while `scrollTop === 0`, fires `onRefresh()` past 70px threshold. Skips on non-touch devices. Wired into Dashboard + Bookings, both using a shared `[data-scroll-root]` selector on App.js's main scroll container.
- ✅ **Safe-area-inset CSS** (`index.css`): utility classes `pt-safe`, `pb-safe`, `pl-safe`, `pr-safe`, `mb-safe`, and `h-safe-screen` for PWA notch/home-indicator support on iPhone.
- ✅ End-to-end verified at 390×844: sticky CTA present, tapping scrolls to booking section, ⓘ buttons open the description modal (verified "Training" content: "1-on-1 sessions...", bullet list correct). At 1920×800: sticky CTA correctly hidden, info modal still works centered.

## Sprint 40 — Broad mobile UX sweep (2026-02)
- ✅ **Portal header**: was `h-24 px-8` with logo+tagline+welcome+3 buttons that all overflowed on phones (user's first complaint). Now: 40px logo on mobile / 64px desktop, tagline hidden under `sm:`, welcome name truncates, Logout collapses to icon-only on phones. Padding `p-3` on mobile / `p-8` desktop.
- ✅ **Portal onboarding banner**: tightened padding (`p-4 sm:p-6`), shrunk text sizes, narrowed the "X of 3" pill.
- ✅ **Bookings**: was a 6-column wide table that forced horizontal scroll on phones. Now: hidden on mobile + replaced with stacked cards showing dog/client/service/date/status pill + inline action links. Desktop table unchanged.
- ✅ **Schedule** (`Schedule.jsx` + `index.css`): auto-detects mobile (`matchMedia <=767px`) → switches FullCalendar to `dayGridWeek` view with a compact toolbar (prev/next/today + abbreviated MMM-YY title). Added mobile-only CSS targeting `.fc-toolbar`, `.fc-button`, `.fc-event` to shrink font sizes so events actually fit in narrow day cells.
- ✅ **Clients + Dogs cards**: removed the `opacity-0 group-hover` pattern that hid Edit/Trash icons until hover (broken on touch devices — phone users literally couldn't access them). Now always visible on `<md`, hover-only on desktop.
- ✅ Verified at 390×844 and 1920×800: mobile is now navigable end-to-end; desktop has zero regression (Bookings still shows wide table, Schedule still shows month grid).

## Sprint 39 — Mobile UX overhaul: dog edit + grading (2026-02)
- ✅ **`Modal` component** (`Clients.jsx`): now responsive. Mobile (<640px) renders as a bottom-sheet (`items-end`, `rounded-t-2xl`), tighter padding (`p-5` instead of `p-8`), and a sticky title bar with the close button. Desktop unchanged (centered, `sm:rounded-2xl`, `sm:p-8`). Added `max-h-[95vh] overflow-y-auto` so long forms scroll naturally on phones.
- ✅ **`GoalRow`** (`DogTrainingTab.jsx`): main row was `flex items-center` — on phones, the 6 score buttons (0-5) competed with the goal description for the same horizontal space, causing the chips to overlap the text (visible in user's screenshot). Changed to `flex-col sm:flex-row` so on mobile the goal name sits on its own line and the score chips sit on a new row below. Buttons also enlarged to `w-8 h-8` on mobile for easier tapping.
- ✅ **`StatPill`** (`Dogs.jsx`): label font shrunk from `text-[15px]` to `text-[10px] sm:text-[15px]` and value from `text-xl` to `text-lg sm:text-xl` so the 4 stat tiles fit cleanly in a 2×2 grid on phones without eating half the modal vertical space.
- ✅ **Dog edit modal**: removed the hardcoded `max-h-[75vh]` + nested `overflow-y-auto` inner div that was competing with the new Modal's outer scroll, eliminating double-scrollbars. Promoted modal to `max-w-2xl` for better desktop use of space.
- ✅ Verified at 390×844 (iPhone): score buttons measured cleanly within viewport (x=58 to x_end=303), no overlap. Verified at 1920×800 (desktop): no regression — modal still centered with generous padding.

## Sprint 38 — Check-out frees the slot (2026-02)
- ✅ **Bug**: dogs that had checked out were still counted against daycare/boarding/training capacity for the rest of the day, so the dashboard showed e.g. "4/30" when only one dog was actually on-site.
- ✅ **Fix** (`server.py`):
  - `_booking_days_count_filtered()` (capacity-check helper used at booking creation, quick-check-in cap, and `/bookings/availability`) now skips any booking with `checked_out_at` set.
  - `/api/dashboard/stats` increments `daycare_today/boarding_today/training_today` only when `checked_out_at` is empty.
  - Roster still includes checked-out rows so admin can see who came and went today.
- ✅ Verified: Sparky checked in → 1/30. Sparky checked out → 0/30 with 30 open_slots reported by `/bookings/availability`.

## Sprint 37 — Clickable dog names on client cards (2026-02)
- ✅ **App.js** passes `onJumpToDog={(id)=>{ setSearchTarget({kind:"dog", id}); setTab("dogs"); }}` to `<Clients>`, reusing the same search-navigation pipeline that Pipeline already uses.
- ✅ **Clients.jsx**: each dog name is now a button. Hover shows underline + a subtle blue arrow `→`. Click jumps to the Dogs tab and opens that dog's Edit modal automatically (via existing `focusId` plumbing).
- ✅ Verified: clicking "Buddy" on Alex Owner's card lands on Dogs tab with the Edit Buddy modal open and all fields populated.

## Sprint 36 — Client Hub: Dog list per client card (2026-02)
- ✅ **Backend** (`server.py`): added `dogs: List[{id,name,breed}]` to `ClientOut`. `GET /api/clients` now pulls all dogs in one query (photo fields excluded), groups by `owner_id`, and attaches the sorted list to each client. No N+1.
- ✅ **Frontend** (`Clients.jsx`): each client card now shows a "🐾 Dogs · N" section between contact info and credit stats. Lists each dog as "{Name} · {Breed}". Empty state: "No dogs on file" in muted grey.
- ✅ Verified live: Alex Owner → Buddy, First Booker → Pixel · Mix, Garrett Compston → A, Celebration Test → Sparky · Lab.

## Sprint 35 — First Booking Email Notification (2026-02)
- ✅ **Email service** (`email_service.py`): new `notify_admin_first_booking(booking, client)` — branded celebratory email with title "🎉 First booking — {Name}", subject prefixed with 🎉, includes client/dog/service/dates + phone/email contact, "Open Admin" CTA. Sends to `ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`.
- ✅ **Backend** (`server.py`): added a single `count_documents({"client_id": ...}) == 1` check right after `db.bookings.insert_one(doc)` in `POST /api/bookings`. Fires for both client-portal and admin-created bookings. Best-effort (try/except so an email hiccup never breaks booking creation).
- ✅ Verified end-to-end via Resend: first booking → email sent to `sithappensohio@gmail.com` (Resend ID `70ed90c2-...`). Second booking for the same client → no additional email. Detection is correct.

## Sprint 40 — True "View Portal as Client" Impersonation (2026-02)
- ✅ Replaced the old read-only ClientPortalPreview snapshot modal with a **real impersonation flow** — `POST /api/admin/clients/{id}/impersonation-token` mints a 15-min client-scoped JWT, frontend saves the admin token into a `sh_admin_token` slot, swaps `sh_token`, and reloads. The admin sees the **actual** Portal, 1:1 with what the client sees (same trophies, same services & pricing, same gallery CTA, same homework, same booking widget).
- ✅ Persistent yellow `ImpersonationBanner` at the top of the page with "Return to Admin" — one click restores the admin token and reloads back to wherever they came from.
- ✅ Token rejects non-admins (403); rejects clients who haven't claimed a portal account yet (400 with helpful "send a Claim Account email first" hint).
- ✅ Backward compat: kept the old "Quick portal snapshot" button on each client card for a faster non-impersonated read-only summary.


- ✅ **`notify_client_quote_received`** Resend template: friendly "Hey {first_name}! Thanks for asking about {item} — someone will be in touch within 24 hours" auto-responder fires on `POST /api/portal/quote-request`. Echoes their listed price + their own message back. CTA returns to portal.
- ✅ **BookingOut model** extended with `extra_nights: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` so the audit dict written at check-out (count, credits_used, billed_nights, per_night_rate, charge, added_at) round-trips back through the API — addresses the only minor finding from iteration 17.
- ✅ **Full regression**: 51/51 backend tests pass (19 iter15 + 21 iter16 + 11 NEW iter17 covering Sprints 37/38/39/39.5). Frontend smoke confirms Quote Requests panel, vaccine alerts, first-booking celebration, leaderboards, unified Settings (no separate Programs nav), portal services-at-bottom + 15 Request Info buttons + gallery CTA. Zero critical bugs. Zero frontend bugs.


- ✅ **Portal layout**: moved the Services & Pricing section out of the left sidebar and below the main 3-column grid so it now spans the **full width** of the screen and sits **at the bottom** — clients see their personal info first, then browse the catalog. 3-column tile grid on desktop, 2-column on tablet, 1-column on mobile.
- ✅ **"Request Info" button** on every service + program tile. Opens a modal with auto-filled name/email/phone (no manual entry) + optional message (500 chars). Submit fires `POST /api/portal/quote-request` → writes `quote_requests` Mongo row → emails the admin via the new `notify_admin_quote_request` Resend template.
- ✅ **Admin Quote Requests panel** on the Dashboard — new "QUOTE REQUESTS · N" card lists open requests with client name, requested item, listed price, timestamp, clickable email/phone, custom message, and "Mark Handled" button (`POST /admin/quote-requests/{id}/close` flips status to `closed`).


- ✅ **Admin Settings**: removed the dedicated "Programs" tab; renamed "Services & Prices" → "Services & Programs" and rebuilt the catalog UI to group services by category (Daycare / Boarding / Training / Grooming / Photography / Other), with **Training Programs embedded as a final category section** that hosts the existing `ProgramsPanel` editor.
- ✅ **Programs price field**: added `price: float = 0` to `ProgramIn` Pydantic model. Programs editor now includes a Price input with helper text ("Shown on the client portal so prospects can see what each program costs"). Default-program prices seeded ($450 / $550 / $350 / $1500 / $2750 / $3900).
- ✅ **Client access**: `/api/programs` now returns a slim view (id, name, type, focus, format, price, module_count) to authenticated clients instead of 403.
- ✅ **Portal "Services & Pricing"** redesigned with new `<ServicesByCategory>` component — collapsible sections per category (Daycare, Boarding, Training, Grooming, Photography, Other, Training Programs). Service tiles show price + Credit-eligible vs Pay-on-the-day tag. Program tiles show price (or "Contact"), program type, format (sessions/weeks), and minimum age.


- ✅ **Per-client photo gallery URL**: new `photo_gallery_url` field on Client doc; admin Clients form has a labeled input; Portal renders a prominent "SEE YOUR PUP IN ACTION · ORDER PRINTS" gradient card linking to the client's private gallery. Global Settings field demoted to "Fallback Only".
- ✅ **Portal "Services & Pricing" section**: dedicated card at the top of the portal listing all active services from `/api/services` with name, FontAwesome icon (or service color), description, base price, service type, and "Credit-eligible" vs "Pay-on-the-day" tags. Footer note nudges clients toward Credit Packs.
- ✅ **Photography as a first-class service type**: added to all `Literal` enums (`BookingIn.service_type`, `ServiceIn.service_type`), to AdminBookingModal + Portal booking pickers, to ServicesSettings admin chip, to ServiceInfoModal default description ("Professional pet photography sessions…"), and to Settings → Service Descriptions panel. Photography is pay-on-the-day (no credit pool) — handled automatically by existing `_service_cost` returning 0 + `_credit_balance_field` returning None.
- ✅ **Boarding stay extension at checkout**:
  - `CheckoutIn` extended with `extra_nights` (0–60), `extra_nights_use_credits` (bool), `extra_nights_rate` (optional float override).
  - `check_out` endpoint extends `booking.end_date` by N days, optionally FIFO-consumes additional boarding credits, then bills uncovered nights at the per-night rate. Writes `extra_nights` audit dict on the booking for income reporting.
  - **Dashboard CheckoutModal**: new "🌙 STAYED EXTRA NIGHTS?" panel (boarding bookings only) with ± stepper, "Use remaining boarding credits first" toggle, per-night rate override, and live charge preview.
- ✅ **End-to-end verified**: photography service created/listed/booked, portal renders all 8 services beautifully, boarding extension test confirmed `end_date: 2026-05-18 → 2026-05-20` with `actual_price: $165` ($55 base + 2 × $55) and audit row written.


- ✅ **New collections:** `trophies` (catalog) + `awarded_trophies` (instances). 15 defaults seeded on startup (6 dog + 9 client), all idempotent via `seed_trophies_if_empty()` so admin edits are never overwritten.
- ✅ **Backend `/app/backend/trophy_service.py`** — central engine: `award_trophy()` (idempotent per `recipient_id`+`code`), `check_dog_trophies()`, `check_client_trophies()`, `render_share_card_png()` (Pillow, 1200×630 social-card).
- ✅ **Auto-award hooks wired into existing endpoints:**
  - `update_goal` (training goal score 5) → re-evaluates Dog trophies (`Quick Learner` / `Skill Master` / `Top Dog` / `Sit Happens Graduate`).
  - `complete_homework` → re-evaluates Client trophies (`Homework Hero` 7-day streak, `Dedicated Owner` / `Coach of the Year` count tiers).
  - `check_out` → re-evaluates Client trophies for the dog's owner (`Regular` / `Loyal Pack Member` / `Sit Happens Legend` visit tiers) AND for the referrer if a referral row was just inserted (`Friend Bringer` / `Pack Builder` / `Ambassador`).
- ✅ **12+ new endpoints** under `/api/trophies/...` + `/api/dogs|clients/{id}/trophies` + `/api/portal/trophies` + `/api/trophies/share-card/{awarded_id}.png` + `/api/trophies/leaderboard`. Admin auth on catalog CRUD + manual award + revoke + leaderboard. Defaults can be deactivated but not hard-deleted.
- ✅ **Frontend:**
  - New `<TrophyBadge>` + `<TrophyWall>` + `<TrophyCelebration>` components with tier-aware styling (bronze/silver/gold/platinum rings, Font Awesome glyphs OR admin-uploaded custom image).
  - New admin **Trophies** nav tab (`/app/frontend/src/screens/Trophies.jsx`) — full catalog manager with live-preview editor, custom-image upload, tier picker, threshold editor, deactivate toggle.
  - **Admin Clients & Dogs** screens — each card now shows a trophy strip + "+ Award" button opening `ManualAwardPicker`.
  - **Admin Dashboard** — new "Top Dogs" + "Top Clients" leaderboard widgets (#1 yellow, #2 silver, #3 bronze ranking).
  - **Client Portal** — new "TROPHY WALL" section between Training Progress and Homework, plus a celebratory modal queue on portal load that shows `NEW TROPHY EARNED!` for every unseen award (auto-marked seen via `/awarded-trophies/{id}/seen`).
  - **Share card PNG** is generated server-side on demand; portal/admin trophy detail modal renders it inline with Download + Copy-share-link buttons.
- ✅ **Testing:** 21/21 backend pytest (`/app/backend/tests/test_iter16_trophies.py`) + frontend smoke via Playwright. Covers seeding, idempotent awards, admin CRUD, auth gating, share-card PNG dimensions, seen-flag, revoke, auto-award on 10th checkout and on 7-day homework streak. Zero bugs found.


- ✅ **Backend** (`server.py`):
  - `GET /api/admin/vaccine-cert-uploads?include_reviewed=false` — lists client-uploaded certs with photo, expiry, owner, uploaded_at, reviewed_at. Defaults to unreviewed-only.
  - `POST /api/admin/dogs/{dog_id}/vaccine-cert/{vaccine}/review` — approves a cert (stamps reviewed_at + reviewed_by). Vaccine expiry untouched.
  - `DELETE /api/admin/dogs/{dog_id}/vaccine-cert/{vaccine}` — rejects: removes the cert AND clears the matching vaccine expiry so the dog is blocked from new bookings until reuploaded.
  - **CRITICAL FIX:** A previous edit had nested these endpoints inside an `if ref_code:` block, causing an `IndentationError` and a stale-cached backend. Hoisted to module level — backend now boots cleanly.
- ✅ **Backend referral hook** moved from "first booking" → **"first completed checkout (any service)"** per user request. Fires from `POST /api/bookings/{booking_id}/check-out`. Idempotent via `referrals` collection guard (`referred_id` lookup). Skips self-referrals. Writes both `referrals` audit row and `credit_adjustments` entry with `{daycare: {before, delta:1, after}}`.
- ✅ **Backend `auth/register`** now accepts `referred_by_code` field — normalizes/uppercases, validates against existing `referral_code`, persists on the new client doc (or stores `null` if invalid/empty).
- ✅ **Frontend** (`Dashboard.jsx`): new "Pending Vaccine Reviews · N" panel between vaccine alerts and first-booking banner. Renders thumbnail (click → lightbox), dog/owner, vaccine pill, expiry, uploaded-at, plus Approve / Reject buttons. Reject uses `useConfirm` to warn about clearing expiry.
- ✅ **Frontend** (`Login.jsx`): auto-detects `?ref=CODE` URL param → flips to Register tab and pre-fills referral code input. Updated copy: "Your friend gets a free daycare day once you finish your first appointment!"
- ✅ **Frontend** (`Portal.jsx`): Refer-a-Friend modal copy updated to reflect new trigger: "After they sign up and complete their first appointment…".
- ✅ End-to-end verified via curl:
  - Referrer at 8 credits → new client registers w/ `?ref=7KTUMQ` → books → credits stay 8 → check-in + check-out → credits jump to 9 → 2nd checkout (different booking) → still 9 (idempotent).
  - Pending list returns/excludes reviewed properly; approve stamps reviewed_at; reject removes cert + zeroes expiry.


- ✅ **Backend** (`server.py`): added `_first_time_bookings_today()` helper called from `/api/dashboard/stats`. Logic: pull bookings created today (uses indexed `created_at` range filter), aggregate by client_id to find each client's earliest booking, include only those whose first-ever booking falls on today. One Mongo aggregation, deduped per client.
- ✅ **Frontend** (`Dashboard.jsx`): new `<First Booking Celebration · N>` banner between the vaccine alerts and the upcoming birthdays. Green/blue gradient pill chips with a paw icon, "{Client} just booked their first {service} for {Dog} · {date}." Auto-disappears the next day. Hidden when zero qualifying bookings.
- ✅ End-to-end verified: dashboard renders the banner with the 3 first-time bookings seeded by the test pipeline today.

## Sprint 33 — Account Claim by Email (2026-02)
- ✅ **Backend** (`server.py`): new `POST /api/clients/{client_id}/send-claim-email` (admin-only) generates a 32-byte `secrets.token_urlsafe` claim token in collection `claim_tokens` `{token, client_id, email, is_reset, used, created_at, expires_at}`. 7-day expiry. Re-callable any time — issuing a new token deletes older unused tokens for the same client. Auto-detects whether to send a "claim" (no user yet) or "password reset" (existing portal user) email.
- ✅ **Backend public endpoints** (no auth): `GET /api/claim/{token}` returns `{valid, client_name, email, is_reset, expires_at}`. `POST /api/claim/{token}` body `{password}` either creates the portal user (claim) or updates the existing user's password (reset), burns the token, and returns an `AuthOut` (JWT + user) so the client is auto-logged in.
- ✅ **Email service** (`email_service.py`): `send_account_claim(...)` reuses the existing branded `_wrap()` template with a step-by-step instructions box ("1. Tap the button below 2. Choose a password 3. You'll be signed in"), a 7-day expiry note, and the PWA install QR footer.
- ✅ **Frontend admin** (`Clients.jsx`): every client card now has a prominent green "Send Claim Account Email" button (or "Send Password Reset Email" if portal account exists). Adding a new client with an email **auto-sends** the claim email on save and shows an inline toast. The manual "Create Portal Login" modal is preserved as a secondary fallback button.
- ✅ **Frontend public** (`Claim.jsx` + `App.js`): new public route `/claim/:token` handled *before* `<AuthProvider>` so unauthenticated visitors can land there. Branded card with Sit Happens logo, welcome message, email confirmation, password + confirm inputs, "Activate Account" CTA. On success, stores the returned JWT in `sh_token` and redirects to `/`, dropping the client straight into their portal.
- ✅ End-to-end verified via Playwright: admin creates a fresh client with an email → toast confirms "Claim email sent" → token stored in DB → public claim URL renders the welcome card → password set → user auto-logged into portal showing onboarding checklist. Zero console errors.

## Sprint 32 — Hotfix: Client Portal Missing useConfirm Import (2026-02)
- ✅ `Portal.jsx` called `useConfirm()` on line 17 without importing it → every client login crashed with "useConfirm is not defined" caught by ErrorBoundary.
- ✅ Added `import { useConfirm } from "../lib/useConfirm";` to Portal.jsx.
- ✅ Scanned all other `.jsx`/`.js` consumers of `useConfirm()` — every one has the proper import. No other missing-import cases.
- ✅ Verified end-to-end: `testclient@sithappens.com` logs in, portal renders credits / dogs / training progress / homework / booking form with zero console errors.

## Sprint 31 — Hotfix: Frontend Compile Errors + Missing ConfirmProvider (2026-02)
- ✅ Removed stray duplicated `);\n}` block trailing the `App` component in `/app/frontend/src/App.js` (lines 163-164) that crashed the bundler.
- ✅ Removed 12 lines of duplicated JSX trailing the proper close of `Settings.jsx` (lines 736-747) that caused a Babel "Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped" error.
- ✅ **Critical fix:** `ConfirmProvider` was imported in `App.js` but never mounted, so every screen using the `useConfirm` hook (Clients, Dogs, Bookings, Homework, Income, Incidents, Pipeline) threw `useConfirm must be used inside <ConfirmProvider />` and was caught by ErrorBoundary as "Something tripped up." Wrapped `<Gate />` + `<InstallPrompt />` inside `<ConfirmProvider>`.
- ✅ End-to-end verified via Playwright: logged in as admin and successfully navigated all 8 affected screens with zero page errors / zero console errors.

## Sprint 39 — Credit Pack Crash Fix + Per-Client Photo Gallery PIN (2026-02)

## Sprint 40 — "New Photos Available" Nudge (2026-02)
- ✅ Added `photo_gallery_has_new: bool = False` to `ClientIn`. Admin can flip per-client via a new toggle row in the Clients edit modal ("Notify of New Photos" → "New photos badge: ON").
- ✅ Portal CTA "See Your Pup In Action" gets a pulsing orange "NEW" pill, an orange glow shadow, and switched copy ("Fresh photos just dropped!") whenever the flag is set.
- ✅ New endpoint `POST /api/portal/gallery/mark-seen` auto-clears the flag the moment the client clicks the gallery link (fire-and-forget on the client; optimistically clears the badge locally without a reload). Idempotent.

## Sprint 41 — Recurring Schedules + Daily Automation (2026-02)
- ✅ **Recurring Schedule Templates** (#4): new admin sidebar entry **"Recurring"** lets you save per-dog weekly cadences (Daisy · M/W/F daycare) and roll the schedule forward N weeks with one click. Reuses the existing `/bookings/recurring` engine; tracks `last_booked_through` so successive extends start the day after the previously booked window. New endpoints: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/recurring-templates` + `POST /api/recurring-templates/{id}/extend`.
- ✅ **Daily Jobs runner** (`daily_jobs.py`): lightweight lazy scheduler — triggered the first time the admin loads `/dashboard/stats` each UTC day, gated by `system_runs` so it fires at most once per day. Idempotent per-target via `notification_log` collection. No external scheduler process needed.
- ✅ **Dog Birthday Cards** (#7): on the dog's birthday (MM-DD match), owner gets a celebratory email featuring the dog's first photo as a hero image. De-duped per dog per year.
- ✅ **Vaccine Renewal Nudge** (#6): when any of `rabies / bordetella / dhpp` expires exactly 30 days from today, the owner gets one consolidated email listing every renewal due, with a CTA to upload the new record. De-duped per (dog, target-date).
- ✅ **Settings → Email Automation panel**: shows which jobs are on, plus a "Run Daily Jobs Now" button that bypasses the once-per-day gate and shows sent/skipped counts (handy for testing).
- 🟡 **Parked — S3 photo migration (#10)**: user will set up a Cloudflare R2 account before next session.


- ✅ **Fixed Credit Pack "Add" crash**: FastAPI 422 returns `detail` as an array of error objects; `CreditPacksSettings.jsx` was rendering it raw inside `<p>`, tripping the ErrorBoundary. Added client-side guards (name/qty/price) and routed all server errors through `formatErr` to flatten arrays. Verified empty-name now shows inline "Pack name is required." with the UI staying alive.

## Sprint 42 — Vaccine-First Onboarding Modal (2026-02)
- ✅ **OnboardingChecklist modal** auto-pops on every portal load when the client either has no dog yet OR any required vaccine (`rabies`/`bordetella`/`dhpp`) is missing or already expired. Big orange "Action Required" header, friendly welcome, per-dog list of missing vaccines with one-click Upload buttons that hand off to the existing `VaccineUploadModal`. Has an explicit "Remind me later" dismiss that persists for the browser session via `sessionStorage`.
- ✅ **OnboardingBanner** — a sticky orange strip pinned ABOVE the portal header that's always visible while vaccines are incomplete: "N vaccines need uploading before you can book · FINISH SETUP". Tapping reopens the modal even after dismissal.
- ✅ Designed to coexist with the existing 3-step "Welcome to Sit Happens" banner (profile/dog/waiver) — the modal handles the *specific* vaccine action gap, the existing banner handles initial profile setup.

- ✅ **Per-client Photo Gallery Download PIN**: Added `photo_gallery_pin` field to `ClientIn` (backend) and to the Clients admin edit form (next to gallery URL). Portal renders a compact PIN card under "See Your Pup In Action" with monospace-spaced PIN value and a one-click Copy button (`<GalleryPinRow>` in `Portal.jsx`). Blank PIN = row hidden. Shown only when the client also has a gallery URL.


## Key Files
- `/app/backend/server.py` — All endpoints + models

## Sprint 43 — Add Client + Dog in One Modal (2026-02)
- ✅ The admin **New Client** modal now has an **"Also add a dog"** toggle (default ON) that reveals a compact dog quick-add form: name, breed, age (yrs + mos), sex, fixed status, vaccine expiry dates (rabies/bordetella/dhpp), and notes.
- ✅ Save flow does it in one shot: `POST /clients` → `POST /dogs` with the new owner_id → claim email → load. If the dog POST fails (e.g. malformed vaccine date), the client still saves and a warn toast surfaces the message so the admin can finish the dog from the Dogs screen.
- ✅ Section is hidden when **editing** an existing client (keeps the edit modal lean) and only appears on **New Client** creation.
- ✅ Helper copy under vaccine inputs: "Leave blank if you don't have them yet — the client will be prompted to upload through their portal" — ties cleanly into Sprint 42's onboarding modal.

- `/app/backend/.env` — JWT_SECRET, ADMIN creds, DAYCARE_CAPACITY
- `/app/frontend/src/App.js` — Role-based gate
- `/app/frontend/src/lib/{api,auth}.js` — Axios + AuthContext

## Sprint 44 — Vaccine Cert Attach in New-Client Modal (2026-02)
- ✅ New admin endpoint `POST /dogs/{dog_id}/vaccine-cert` mirrors the portal cert-upload endpoint. Admin-uploaded certs are auto-marked `reviewed_at` so they skip the Pending Vaccine Reviews queue.
- ✅ The quick-add-dog vaccine section now uses a per-row `<VaccineCertRow>` with three entry methods for the cert image: file picker, drag-and-drop onto the row, **or paste from clipboard** (`Cmd/Ctrl+V` while focus is on the row). Thumbnail + Clear button preview after upload.
- ✅ Save flow chains 4 calls automatically: `POST /clients` → `POST /dogs` → up to 3 `POST /dogs/{id}/vaccine-cert` (one per attached cert) → claim email. A failed cert attach doesn't block the rest.
- ✅ Cert photos compressed via `compressImage` before transmission to keep payloads small.

- `/app/frontend/src/screens/` — Login, Dashboard, Schedule, Bookings, Clients, Dogs, Portal
- `/app/memory/test_credentials.md` — Login credentials


## Sprint 45 — Trophy Share PNG Reads the Uploaded Image (2026-02)
- ✅ Fixed the long-standing bug where every shared trophy showed the same hard-coded `★` glyph — the renderer (`trophy_service.py::render_share_card_png`) now reads `trophy_custom_image` and pastes it into the centre of the tier ring with a circular mask. Falls back to the star glyph cleanly when no image is uploaded.
- ✅ Snapshots `trophy_custom_image` onto every new award record so historical shares keep their visual even if the admin later edits or removes the catalog image.
- ✅ The public `/api/trophies/share-card/{awarded_id}.png` endpoint backfills the image from the live catalog for awards minted before the snapshot existed, so existing trophies start showing the right image the moment an admin uploads one.
- ✅ Fixed a related call-site bug in `Trophies.jsx` where `compressImage(f, 256, 0.85)` was passing positional args to an options-based API — now uses `{maxWidth: 512, maxHeight: 512, quality: 0.85}` for a sharper trophy thumbnail.
- ✅ End-to-end verified: uploaded a solid-red test image → awarded → share PNG centre pixel was `(220, 30, 30)`. With no image → centre showed the tier ring fill colour with the ★ glyph (fallback works).


## Sprint 46 — Unenroll, Cascade Program Edits, Unlimited Daycare Booking Range (2026-02)
- ✅ **Unenroll button** on every active enrollment in the Dog → Training tab. Triggers a confirm dialog ("Progress preserved in History · resume any time"), then flips the enrollment to `withdrawn` and clears the dog's active-program pointer. Stays in History → "Resume" button can reactivate.
- ✅ **Cascade program edits**: `PUT /api/programs/{id}?cascade=true` now syncs the updated snapshot to every active enrollment of that program. Goal scores survive when goal IDs match; new goals start "not started"; removed goals' progress is dropped silently. Editor UI auto-counts active enrollments and shows a confirm dialog *"Apply changes to N enrolled dogs?"* (Yes → cascade, No → only future enrollments use the new version). New helper endpoint `GET /api/programs/{id}/active-enrollments-count`.
- ✅ **Daycare advance-days cap lifted** for clients: `create_booking` now exempts `service_type=daycare` from the `max_advance_days` rule, so recurring schedules can run any distance into the future. Boarding/training/grooming still respect the cap. Verified: client booked daycare 120 days out (success), client booked boarding 120 days out (blocked with the 60-day message).


## Sprint 47 — Client Recurring Schedules + Schedule Auto-refresh (2026-02)
- ✅ **Role-aware `/recurring-templates`**: all five endpoints (list / create / update / delete / extend) now accept clients via `get_current_user`. Server-side scoping ensures clients only see/modify templates for their own dogs. Helper `_assert_dog_owned_by_client` blocks cross-client tampering with a 403 "Not your dog".
- ✅ **Training restriction respected**: clients attempting to create or move a template onto `service_type=training` get a 403 with the same "request a free evaluation" copy used elsewhere in the portal.
- ✅ **`MyRecurringModal` on the Portal**: new Quick Link → "My Recurring Schedules" opens a focused modal with list ↔ form steps. Mirrors the admin Recurring screen: dog dropdown, weekday picker, default-extend-window input, notes, Extend button with progress toast. Hidden when the client has no dogs yet.
- ✅ **Schedule.jsx auto-refresh**: added `visibilitychange` + window `focus` listeners that re-fetch `/events` whenever the user returns to the calendar — defends against the "I just created bookings and they don't show up" problem regardless of which screen created them.


## Sprint 48 — Recurring Start-Date + Day Roster + Timed Training Events (2026-02)
- ✅ **Start-on date** added to `RecurringTemplateIn`. First extend honors it (if in the future); subsequent extends advance from `last_booked_through` as before. Both admin and client recurring UIs have the new date picker with the "leave blank to start today" hint.
- ✅ **Day Roster modal** on the Schedule: clicking any day opens an overlay listing every booking that day (with service color chips and the assigned time for training/grooming), plus a "+ New Appointment for this day" CTA that opens an inline quick-add form (dog / service / time / notes / boarding end-date / grooming type).
- ✅ **Training & grooming bookings now timed** — `BookingIn` accepts `time` (HH:MM), `create_booking` persists it, and the `/events` endpoint promotes timed bookings to ISO datetime events with `allDay:false`. Title prefixed with the time. Training defaults to 1-hour duration, grooming 1.5 hours. FullCalendar config: `displayEventTime`, 12-hour meridiem format.

## Sprint 49 — Fix: "+ New Service" button silent + Icon Picker (2026-02)
- ✅ **Bug**: in Settings → Services & Programs, clicking the green "+ New Service" button appeared to do nothing — `openNew()` only reset an inline form rendered below a long catalog list, so admins on a mid-height viewport got zero visual feedback.
- ✅ **Fix** (`ServicesSettings.jsx`): the New/Edit form is now a proper centered modal with overlay, sticky header + close button, and a Cancel CTA. Both "+ New Service" and per-row "Edit" links toggle `open=true`. Save and close both reset state and close the modal.
- ✅ **Visual Icon Picker**: replaced the raw "fa-tag" text input with an `<IconPicker>` component. Tapping the live icon preview opens a searchable popover grid of ~85 curated FontAwesome icons relevant to dog daycare/training/grooming/payments. Search filters by name and keywords (e.g. "paw", "bath", "training"). Click an icon to set the field value + close the popover.
- ✅ Lint clean, smoke-tested in preview (modal opens, picker grid opens, "paw" search filters correctly).




## Sprint 50 — IconPicker on Credit Packs + Mood Tags (2026-02)
- ✅ **`IconPicker` extracted** to `/app/frontend/src/components/IconPicker.jsx` as a reusable component with an `autoOpen` prop so callers can have the grid visible immediately when mounted. ServicesSettings now imports it (deduped from the inline copy).
- ✅ **Credit Packs**: added `icon: Optional[str]` to `CreditPackIn` Pydantic model. Seed defaults (`credit_packs_data.py`) now carry icons (daycare → `fa-sun`, training → `fa-graduation-cap`, boarding → `fa-moon`). Seed-standard endpoint also **backfills the icon onto pre-existing default packs** (one-time idempotent — verified: 11 packs backfilled on first run). Settings → Credit Packs form has the picker; list rows show the chosen icon in a pool-colored chip; Sell-Pack modal also renders the icon next to each pack name so admins recognize their packs at a glance.
- ✅ **Mood Tags**: `SettingsIn.mood_tags` relaxed to `Optional[List[Any]]` so both legacy `List[str]` AND new `List[{label, icon}]` round-trip cleanly through Pydantic. Backend verified accepting both shapes. Settings → Mood Tags now shows each tag as a pill with an icon-toggle button → clicking it opens an inline IconPicker grid (auto-open). Saving persists the `{label, icon}` shape; legacy string tags are normalized on first render. Dashboard ReportCardModal renders the icon next to each selectable tag pill. Portal report-card history looks up the icon from `pubSettings.mood_tags` and renders it inline.
- ✅ Backward compatible: report-card storage still saves `mood_tags: List[str]` (label-only); the icon is metadata on the *catalog*, not on each saved record.
- ✅ Lint clean. Smoke-tested in preview: 16 pack icons rendered on the Credit Packs list, all 8 default mood tags rendered with icons, picker grid auto-opens on click, selecting `fa-heart` updates a tag successfully.


## Sprint 51 — Per-Mood-Tag Color (2026-02)
- ✅ **Tag shape extended** to `{label, icon, color}` (color is an optional hex). Pydantic `Optional[List[Any]]` covers it without further schema changes.
- ✅ **Settings → Mood Tags**: each tag pill now renders an inline **8-color swatch row** (green / blue / orange / purple / pink / red / yellow / slate). Selected swatch gets a white ring; pill background + border + label color all derive from the chosen hex. Default = shGreen if not set.
- ✅ **Dashboard ReportCardModal**: selectable mood pills now render with each tag's own color (inverts to filled bg + dark text when selected).
- ✅ **Portal report-card history**: saved mood tags look up their icon + color from `pubSettings.mood_tags` and render with matching tint.
- ✅ End-to-end verified: set Playful=purple / Calm=orange / Napped Well=blue, saved, full page reload — colors persisted and re-rendered correctly. Lint clean.


## Sprint 52 — Color Picker Everywhere IconPicker Exists (2026-02)
- ✅ **`ColorSwatchRow` extracted** to `/app/frontend/src/components/ColorSwatchRow.jsx` — reusable 8-color brand palette (green / blue / orange / purple / pink / red / yellow / slate). Same palette used by Mood Tags.
- ✅ **Services & Programs**: New/Edit Service modal now has a "Color" swatch row under the Icon picker. Replaces the silent auto-color-from-category behavior (category still suggests one, but admin can override).
- ✅ **Credit Packs**: new `color: Optional[str]` field on `CreditPackIn`. Settings form has a Color swatch row with helper text "Leave blank to use the pool default ({green/purple/orange})". List rows + Sell-Pack modal in `Clients.jsx` render the pack icon in the chosen color (falls back to pool default when empty).
- ✅ Lint clean. Smoke-tested in preview — both modals show the swatch row, picking pink updates the New-Pack form state correctly. Existing data backward-compatible (empty color → pool default).


## Sprint 53 — Live Preview Chips on Edit Forms (2026-02)
- ✅ **Services form**: new "Preview" row under the Color picker shows exactly how the service will render in the catalog (icon chip in the chosen color, name, category label, price). Updates as the admin types / picks icon / picks color.
- ✅ **Credit Packs form**: new "Preview" row above the Save button shows the pack as it'll appear in the catalog list — colored icon chip + name + pool · qty unit (sessions/nights/credits) + price. Falls back to pool-default color when admin leaves color blank.
- ✅ Mood Tags already render live previews (the tag pill itself is the preview).
- ✅ Lint clean. Smoke-tested in preview — "Behavioral Consult" service shows purple icon preview, "Holiday Special Pack" shows pink icon preview, both updating in real time as inputs change.


## Sprint 54 — Code Review Quick Wins (2026-02)
- ✅ **`PortalTrainingCard.printCertificate` hardened** — replaced `win.document.write(...)` (linter XSS warning) with a Blob URL + `window.open`. All template interpolations (`dog.name`, `snap.name`, `tm.label`, etc.) now flow through an `escHtml()` helper. Blob URLs auto-revoked after 30s. Behavior identical for users; XSS surface eliminated.
- ✅ **Empty catch blocks → `console.warn`** on API-load failures: Portal `loadAll` / `loadTrophies` / `portal/me` and Schedule `events` / `dogs` loaders now log to the browser console so production issues surface in DevTools. Kept intentional fire-and-forget catches (`navigator.clipboard`, `sessionStorage`) silent — those are UX-only and fail in private browsing without consequence.
- ✅ **Python unused-variable cleanup** — removed dead `public_pct` in `training_data.py` and dead `last_resp` in `test_iter13_sprint17.py`. ruff F841 clean.
- ✅ Deferred (per user agreement): hook-dependency warnings, index-as-key warnings, localStorage→httpOnly migration, `Portal.jsx` / `create_booking()` / `AdminBookingModal` refactor (P2 — working in production, refactor risk vs. value not justified for a solo CRM).


## Sprint 55 — Credit Packs: Edit modal + remove actually hides (2026-02)
- ✅ **Edit was silently failing visually** (same root cause as the earlier "+ New Service" bug): clicking Edit on a pack row only updated the inline form that lived below a long list. Converted New/Edit into a proper centered modal — instant visual feedback, sticky header with × close, name/qty/price/icon/color all pre-filled when entering edit mode. New "+ New Pack" header button added; row Edit buttons now wire to `openEdit(p)`.
- ✅ **Removed packs now disappear**: dropped `include_inactive: true` from the list fetch. Custom packs (hard-deleted) and default packs (soft-deleted → `active=false`) both stop showing on the catalog. Lots already issued from removed packs still redeem normally — only the catalog row hides.
- ✅ Smoke-tested in preview: row count went 16 → 14 after dropping inactive; Edit modal opens with "Single Day Drop-In" pre-filled and `fa-sun` icon preview showing live.


## Sprint 56 — Bulk booking = ONE admin email (2026-02)
- ✅ **Bug**: client-driven multi-date and recurring booking flows fired `notify_admin_new_booking` for every single generated date. A "M/W/F · 4 weeks" recurring would spam the operator with 12 emails in a row.
- ✅ **Fix**: introduced a `_suppress_admin_booking_email` `contextvars.ContextVar` flag. `create_booking` checks the flag and skips the per-booking admin alert when set. Both `/bookings/recurring` and `/bookings/multi-dates` now wrap their loop in `set(True)` / `finally reset`, then send ONE summary email (`notify_admin_bulk_booking`) after the loop.
- ✅ **New email template** (`email_service.notify_admin_bulk_booking`) — branded summary listing client, dog, service, dates (first 10 inline + "(+N more)"), and any skipped dates with reasons. Subject prefixed `N new bookings · Dog · Service`.
- ✅ Verified end-to-end via curl + log inspection: multi-dates with 3 dates → 1 email; recurring M/W/F × 2 weeks creating 6 bookings → 1 email. Prior to the fix the same calls produced 3-4 emails in 700ms.
- ✅ Admin-created bulk bookings (Quick Check-in, etc.) still trigger zero emails (the suppression is on top of the existing "skip self-triggered admin actions" guard). Client first-booking celebration unchanged — fires at most once per client lifetime.


## Sprint 57 — Client Profile Avatars (2026-02)
- ✅ **Avatar component extracted** to `/components/Avatar.jsx` (round, 3 sizes, configurable ring color, icon fallback). Reusable for any "user-ish" UI later.
- ✅ **Backend**: added `photo: Optional[str] = ""` to `ClientIn` (base64 data URL). Stored on the client doc and round-tripped via `PUT /api/clients/{id}` and `POST /api/clients`.
- ✅ **Frontend**:
  - Clients list now shows a round avatar next to each client's name (shBlue ring). Falls back to `fa-user` placeholder when no photo is uploaded.
  - Edit Client modal got a "Profile Photo" row directly under Name: live avatar preview + Upload/Replace + Remove buttons. Uses the existing `compressImage` helper (max 600px, quality 0.8) so payloads stay small.
- ✅ Dogs already had per-dog `photo` rendering on cards — unchanged.
- ✅ Lint clean. Smoke-tested in preview: 47 client avatars render as placeholders; edit modal shows the upload field with helper text.


## Sprint 58 — Trophy custom images render on dog/client cards (2026-02)
- ✅ **Bug**: admin-uploaded custom trophy images only showed up in the catalog preview and on freshly-awarded badges. On already-issued awards, the badge fell back to the FontAwesome icon placeholder.
- ✅ **Root cause #1**: `TrophyBadge.jsx` only checked `t.custom_image` (the catalog field). Awarded rows snapshot the same image under `trophy_custom_image` (different field). Fixed: badge now checks `trophy_custom_image || custom_image`.
- ✅ **Root cause #2**: when admin uploaded a custom image AFTER the trophy was already awarded, prior awards stayed stuck on the icon. Fixed: `PUT /trophies/catalog/{code}` now propagates the `custom_image` change to ALL existing `awarded_trophies` for that code in one update_many. Also ran a one-time backfill in preview to fix historical data (4 awards updated).
- ✅ Smoke-tested in preview: 5 trophy badges now display their uploaded images on the Clients list (Friend Bringer, Pack Builder visible on Alex Owner + other cards). Placeholder icon still shows for trophies where the admin hasn't uploaded an image — exactly the requested behavior.


## Sprint 59 — "Deduct credits at checkout" option (2026-02)
- ✅ **Gap**: prior flow auto-deducted credits at booking time. If a client booked WITHOUT credits then bought a pack later (or admin created the booking), there was no way to settle the booking from credits at checkout — admin was stuck collecting cash.
- ✅ **Backend** (`server.py` `check_out`): added "Case C" — when `use_credits=True` AND no pre-deduction existed AND no `actual_price` is set, consume credits from the client's matching pool (daycare/training/boarding) at checkout. Boarding deducts one credit per night (from `end_date - date`); others deduct 1. Uses the existing FIFO `_consume_credit_lots`, sets `payment_method="credits"`, marks booking paid.
- ✅ **Backend**: also added the missing `GET /clients/{client_id}` endpoint (was implicit gap — only PUT/DELETE existed).
- ✅ **Frontend** (`Dashboard.jsx` `CheckoutModal`):
  - Fetches the client's live balance on mount.
  - When booking has NO pre-deduction AND client has enough credits in the matching pool, shows two new radio options under "Base service": **"Deduct N credits now"** (with "Client has X available · FIFO from oldest pack") vs **"Charge as regular service"**. Default = charge (so admin actively opts into using credits).
  - If client has SOME but not enough credits (e.g. 2 boarding credits but a 3-night booking), the existing "no credits on file" copy now also includes an inline orange notice explaining the gap.
  - Submit logic no longer overrides `payment_method` when settling from credits at checkout (was leaking `cash` over Case C).
- ✅ End-to-end verified: created a no-credit booking for Alex Owner, called `/check-out` with `use_credits=true` → his daycare balance went 14 → 13, booking marked paid via credits, FIFO lot consumed. UI screenshot confirms both radio options render on the checkout modal with the live balance ("13 available").


## Sprint 60 — Portal: Bookings tabs + quick-jump button (2026-02)
- ✅ **My Bookings tabs** (`Portal.jsx`): the long flat list is now segmented into **Upcoming / Past / All** with live counts. "Past" = terminal status (completed/cancelled/rejected) OR date already in the past. Upcoming sorted ascending; Past sorted descending (most recent first). Empty-state copy differs per tab. Default tab = Upcoming so clients land on what matters.
- ✅ **Quick-jump button** under "My Profile" in the credits side card: a "My Bookings · N" button that smooth-scrolls to the bookings section. Saves the long page scroll on mobile.
- ✅ Lint clean. Smoke-tested in preview as Test Client (41 bookings: 9 upcoming, 32 past). Tabs and counts render correctly, scroll-jump works.


## Sprint 61 — Admin Schedule: clickable events + booking detail modal (2026-02)
- ✅ **`GET /api/bookings/{id}`** primitive added (admin or owning client). Returns the full booking doc — used by the detail modal to load notes, payment status, etc. without paging the full /bookings list.
- ✅ **`Schedule.jsx` `eventClick`**: clicking any FullCalendar event chip now opens a `BookingDetailModal` showing service badge + status + payment badge, client, date(s)/time/kennel, charged amount or credit value, notes (highlighted card), report-card note (green tinted), and a Cancel action that hits `DELETE /bookings/{id}` (auto-refunds credits via the existing flow).
- ✅ **Day-roster rows clickable**: each row in the day-roster modal is now a button that opens the booking detail layered on top. Two-deep modal works (z-50 vs z-60). Common workflow: click day → see roster → click a name → read notes.

## Sprint 61b — Portal: Month filter on "All" tab (2026-02)
- ✅ Added a month dropdown that appears only when the **All** tab is active AND the client has bookings spanning more than one month. Built from `bookings[].date.slice(0,7)` sorted descending. Empty months show a tailored empty state. Switching tabs clears the month filter so it doesn't leak across views.
- ✅ Lint clean. Smoke-tested in preview as Test Client: dropdown shows "July 2026 / June 2026 / May 2026", picking July filters the list to 5 rows.


## Sprint 62 — Schedule booking-detail: inline notes + walk-in shortcut (2026-02)
- ✅ **Inline notes editing**: notes section now always renders (with "Add" link when empty). Edit toggle reveals a 3-row textarea + Save/Cancel buttons. Save hits `PATCH /api/bookings/{id}` and shows a green "✓ NOTES SAVED" flash for 1.8s. Doesn't close the modal so admin can keep tweaking.
- ✅ **"Add to today's roster" walk-in shortcut**: visible only when the booking is in the past (terminal status or date < today). Clicking it opens a confirm, then `POST /bookings { dog_id, date: today, service_type, check_in_now: true }` so the dog lands directly on the run-sheet. Closes the modal + triggers parent refresh. Saves the operator from re-entering the dog/service when a regular calls last-minute.
- ✅ Lint clean. Smoke-tested in preview: edited Daisy's daycare notes, save flashes correctly, notes persist + re-render in read mode with Edit link, both action buttons visible.


## Sprint 63 — Year-end CSV export + closed-day enforcement (2026-02)
- ✅ **Year-end income export**: new `GET /api/admin/income/export.csv?year=YYYY` returns a CSV (paid bookings + sold credit packs) with date / type / client / dog / service / amount / payment method / payment status / id columns + a trailing total row. Defaults to current year. Wired a blue "Download YYYY Income (.csv)" button into Settings → Backup & Restore.
- ✅ **Closed-day enforcement**: added `closed_dates: List[str]` to `SettingsIn` + exposed it on `/public/settings`. `create_booking` now blocks client-side bookings that fall on any closed date (single-day or any day in a boarding range) with a friendly message. Admin still bypasses (matches their override-everything philosophy).
- ✅ **UI**: new "Closed Days" section in Settings → Hours tab — date picker + Add button + per-row delete, with each row rendered as a localized "Sat, Dec 25, 2027" pill (calendar-xmark icon).
- ✅ Backup endpoint **already existed** (`/backup/export`) — verified via inspection. Removed my duplicate.
- ✅ Vet info fields **already existed** on Dog model + both admin and portal Add Dog forms — nothing to add.
- ✅ End-to-end verified via curl: closed-day block returns 400 "Sit Happens is closed on 2027-12-25" for a client booking; CSV export returns 23 rows incl. "2026 TOTAL: $1,740.00" trailer. UI screenshots show both new sections rendered correctly.


## Sprint 65 — Calendar time fix + birthday on one-shot Client+Dog (2026-02)
- ✅ **Schedule calendar duplicate time fix** (`server.py` `/events`): training/grooming events were rendering as `"2:16pm 14:16 · Buddy (training)"` because the backend prepended the time to the title while FullCalendar also rendered its own native time prefix. Removed the redundant title prefix so events now render cleanly as `"2:16pm Buddy (training)"`.
- ✅ **Birthday field on one-shot Client+Dog modal** (`Clients.jsx`): added a `Birthday (optional)` date input to the quick-add-dog section so admins get feature parity with the standalone Dog form. `birthday` is now part of `emptyDog` and is included in the `POST /api/dogs` payload when the modal is submitted. Backend already accepts `birthday` on the Dog model — no server changes needed.
- ✅ Verified both fixes via screenshot tool: birthday input visible between Age and Sex; May 2026 calendar shows the clean `2:16pm Buddy (training)` chip.



## Sprint 66 — Self-host workflow finalized (2026-02)
- ✅ User migrated from zip-download (`sithappens-main`) to proper `git clone` on Bazzite Linux PC. Stopped orphan containers (folder deleted but containers cached), preserved MongoDB volume `sit-happens_mongo_data`, restored `.env` from `sit-happens.old`, and restarted with `docker compose -p sit-happens up -d --build` so the existing data volume re-attached.
- ✅ Made GitHub repo public to avoid PAT/expiry headaches (no secrets in repo — `.env` is gitignored).
- ✅ Verified app loads on phone with all historical data intact. `./update.sh` is now functional for future one-command updates.

## Sprint 67 — Nightly auto-backups to Google Drive (2026-02)
- ✅ **`backup-now.sh`**: runs `mongodump` inside the mongo container (uses the existing `./backups` bind mount), stages the dump + `.env` + `docker-compose.yml` + a RESTORE.md, tars+gzips to `~/sit-happens-backups/sit-happens-backup-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`, rotates locally (keeps newest 14), then uploads to Google Drive via rclone (`gdrive:sit-happens-backups`). Cloud upload is best-effort — if Drive is down the local copy still succeeds.
- ✅ **`setup-auto-backup.sh`**: idempotent installer for Bazzite. Drops rclone into `~/.local/bin/` (no rpm-ostree needed for the immutable filesystem), walks user through `rclone config` for Google Drive auth, then installs a systemd --user timer (`sit-happens-backup.timer`) running nightly at 03:00 with 5min randomized delay. Calls `loginctl enable-linger` so backups continue when the user is logged out.
- ✅ Both scripts are bash-lint clean. PRD already mentioned user has a Google Drive account.

## Backlog / Next Up
- **P1** Public booking page (no-login request flow from website)
- **P1** Vaccine expiry email blast (one-click email all owners with expiring vaccines via Resend)
- **P2** SMS reminders via Twilio for tomorrow's appointments
- **P2** One-tap waitlist when daycare is full
- **P2** Migrate base64 photo storage to local disk or R2
- **Refactor** Split `server.py` (~5800 lines) into `/app/backend/routes/` modules
## Sprint 68 — Brand & Theme customization (admin global + per-user text size) (2026-02)
- ✅ **Backend** (`server.py`):
  - Extended `SettingsIn` with `brand_primary`, `brand_accent`, `brand_warning`, `brand_font_family` (all Optional[str]).
  - New unauthenticated `GET /api/branding` — returns the 4 brand fields (with defaults) so the login screen can theme itself before auth.
  - New `GET/PUT /api/me/preferences` — stores `text_size` (one of S/M/L/XL) on the user document. Validates the enum, defaults to "M".
- ✅ **Tailwind config**: changed `shGreen/shBlue/shOrange` from hardcoded hexes to `var(--sh-green, ...)` and the sans font to `var(--sh-font, Inter)`. Every existing `bg-shGreen`/`text-shBlue` class is now recolorable at runtime — zero code changes elsewhere.
- ✅ **`lib/theme.js` `ThemeProvider`**: fetches `/api/branding` on boot (cached + applied as CSS vars on `:root`), fetches `/me/preferences` when a token exists, applies html `font-size` from the S/M/L/XL → 16/18.5/21/24px scale, persists user pref to localStorage for instant-no-flicker reloads. Exposes `branding`, `prefs`, `savePrefs`, `saveBranding` via `useTheme()`.
- ✅ **`components/TextSizePicker.jsx`**: shared S/M/L/XL pill picker. Mounted in the admin sidebar (above InstallAppButton) and the client portal credits card.
- ✅ **Settings → Brand & Theme tab** (`Settings.jsx`): new BrandPanel with 3 color pickers (HTML color input + hex text field), font family selector showing 5 options (Inter/Nunito/Poppins/Roboto/System) rendered in their actual typeface, a Live Preview card, Reset-to-defaults link, and Save button with dirty-state detection.
- ✅ Added Nunito/Poppins/Roboto to `public/index.html` Google Fonts preload.
- ✅ E2E verified: logged in as admin, changed primary→#ff5577 + font→Poppins, hit Save → entire app (sidebar active nav, action buttons, settings preview, badges) recolored + retypefaced instantly. Switched text size to XL → all text scaled proportionally. Reverted cleanly. Backend tested via curl: GET /branding (unauth ✓), PUT /settings persists, PUT /me/preferences enforces enum (400 on "Z"), defaults to "M" for new users.

## Backlog / Next Up
- **P1** Public booking page (no-login request flow from website)
- **P1** Vaccine expiry email blast (one-click email all owners with expiring vaccines via Resend)
- **P2** Light mode (current app is dark-only — would need per-screen background/text overrides)
- **P2** SMS reminders via Twilio for tomorrow's appointments
- **P2** One-tap waitlist when daycare is full
- **P2** Migrate base64 photo storage to local disk or R2
- **Refactor** Split `server.py` (~5900 lines) into `/app/backend/routes/` modules

## Sprint 69 — Auto-merge on self-register (2026-02)
- ✅ **`/auth/register` auto-merge logic**: when a client self-registers, the backend now checks if a client record already exists with that email AND has no portal user linked. If so, attaches the new user to the existing client_id instead of creating a duplicate. Preserves pre-loaded dogs, credits, bookings, vaccine certs, etc.
- ✅ Email match is case-insensitive (regex with `^...$` and `i` flag).
- ✅ Referral code on register only updates the existing client if it didn't already have one (admin's data wins).
- ✅ Duplicate-email block on `users` is still in place — prevents re-registration when a portal user already exists.
- ✅ Feature (c) — auto-claim-email on admin client creation — was already implemented in `Clients.jsx` save flow (lines 130-141): when a new client is created with an email, `/clients/{id}/send-claim-email` fires automatically and a toast confirms "Claim email sent to {email}".
- ✅ E2E tested via curl: admin creates Alice with 5 credits + dog Rex, Alice self-registers, logs in, sees Rex and 5 credits, only 1 client record exists in DB.

## Backlog / Next Up
